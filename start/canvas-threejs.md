# Three.js

**What is [Three.js](https://it.esotericsoftware.com/)?** Three.js is a JavaScript library that makes it easy to render 3D graphics in a web browser. It uses WebGL to render 3D graphics in the browser. Three.js is a popular choice for creating 3D graphics on the web.

Having the ability interact with 3D elements can be very useful in many cases.

The [three-pixi](https://it.esotericsoftware.com/three-pixi) library provides this capability to PixiJS.

Currently, this functionality is not available in Pixi'VN, but we plan to implement it. Add a like or comment to [this discussion](https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/pixi-vn/discussions/347)
