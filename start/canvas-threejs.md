**What is Three.js?** Three.js is a JavaScript library that makes it easy to render 3D graphics in a web browser. It uses WebGL to render 3D graphics in the browser. Three.js is a popular choice for creating 3D graphics on the web.

You can learn more about Three.js on the [Three.js website](https://threejs.org/).

Having the ability interact with 3D elements can be very useful in many cases.

The [three-pixi](https://pixijs.com/8.x/guides/advanced/mixing-three-and-pixi#example-combining-3d-and-2d-elements) library provides this capability to PixiJS.
