This component gives the possibility to add light effects.

You should create a library that allows you to use this component in Pixi'VN (components designed for PixiJS do not have functionality to save their current state and then restore it with a save). -> <https://pixi-vn.web.app/start/canvas-elements.html#custom-elements>




Having the ability to create light and shadow effects can be very useful in many cases.

The AAA library provides this capability to PixiJS.

Currently, this functionality is not available in Pixi'VN, but we plan to implement it. Add a like or comment to [this discussion](https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/pixi-vn/discussions/283) to show your interest in this feature.
