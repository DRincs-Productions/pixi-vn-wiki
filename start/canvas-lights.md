Having the ability to create light and shadow effects can be very useful in many cases.

The [PixiJS Lights](https://userland.pixijs.io/lights/docs/index.html) library provides this capability to PixiJS.

Currently, this functionality is not available in Pixi'VN, but we plan to implement it. Add a like or comment to [this discussion](https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/pixi-vn/discussions/283) to show your interest in this feature.
