# Spine 2D

**What is [Spine 2D](https://it.esotericsoftware.com/)?** Spine 2D is a powerful 2D animation software specifically designed for game development. It utilizes a skeletal animation system, meaning that characters and objects are animated using a hierarchy of "bones" that control the movement of attached parts.

Having the ability to use elements with advanced animations can be very useful in many cases.

The [spine-pixi](https://it.esotericsoftware.com/spine-pixi) library provides this capability to PixiJS.

Currently, this functionality is not available in Pixi'VN, but we plan to implement it. Add a like or comment to [this discussion](https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/pixi-vn/discussions/284) to show your interest in this feature.
