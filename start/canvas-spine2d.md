This component gives the possibility to create 2D animations with Spine 2D: <https://it.esotericsoftware.com/>

You should create a library that allows you to use this component in Pixi'VN (components designed for PixiJS do not have functionality to save their current state and then restore it with a save). -> <https://pixi-vn.web.app/start/canvas-elements.html#custom-elements>







Having the ability to use elements with advanced animations can be very useful in many cases.

The AAA library provides this capability to PixiJS.

Currently, this functionality is not available in Pixi'VN, but we plan to implement it. Add a like or comment to this discussion to show your interest in this feature.
