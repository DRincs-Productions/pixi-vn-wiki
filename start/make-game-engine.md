One of the main goals of Pixiâ€™VN is to provide basic utilities for developing video games. The engine is designed to be modular and flexible, allowing developers to use only the parts they need for their specific projects. This modularity also makes it easier to maintain and update the engine over time. Additionally, a developer may want to add or change the handling of a new feature, making sure that all the features of the game engine fit together perfectly.

It is for this very reason that we wanted to make it possible to create your own game engine using the pixi-vn package. This is a very simple process
