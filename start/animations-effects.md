# Animations and effects

Pixiâ€™VN provides a set of animations and effects that can be applied to canvas components.

**What is a animation?** An animation is a Ticker that moves a canvas component without altering the texture. For example, you can move a canvas component from `(0, 0)` to `(100, 100)`.

**What is a effect?** An effect is a Ticker that alters the texture of a canvas component. For example, you can fade a canvas component.

Animations and effects are divided into two categories:

* **Primitives**: They are classes, that can be used to perform basic actions. For example, the `MoveTicker` class is a primitive that can be used to move a canvas component. They are based on [Ticker](/start/tickers). So for add, remove... a primitive you can read the [Tickers documentation](/start/tickers). The advantage is that they can be joined to create more complex animations and effects.
* **Articulated**: They are functions that can be used to perform complex actions. They combine more primitive animations and effects to create a more complex animation or effect. For example, the `Shake` function is an articulated animation that add more `MoveTicker` to create a shake effect.

Primitive animations:

* [Move](#move)
* [Rotate](#rotate)

## Move

For moving a canvas component in `(x, y)` direction you can use the `MoveTicker` class.
This Ticker will edit the `x` and `y` properties to reach the destination.

`MoveTicker` have a constructor that takes the a object with the following properties:

* `destination`: is an object that contains the destination of the movement. It has the following properties:
  * `x`: is a number that represents the destination in the x direction.
  * `y`: is a number that represents the destination in the y direction.
  * `type` (Optional): is a string that represents the type of the destination. Possible values are `pixel`, `percentage` and `align`:
    * `pixel`: The destination is in pixel.
    * `percentage`: The destination is in percentage.
    * `align`: The destination is in align.
    default is `pixel`.
* `speed` (Optional): is a number that represents the speed of the movement.
* `speedProgression` (Optional): in case the movement needs to increase/decrease in speed over time, this property can be used. You can read more about it [here](#speed-progression-property).
* `startOnlyIfHaveTexture` (Optional): is a boolean that represents if the animation should start only if the canvas component have a texture not empty. If `true` and the canvas component not have a texture, the animation will not edit the `x` and `y` properties, but will be executed. You can read more about it [here](#start-only-if-have-texture-property).
* `aliasToRemoveAfter` (Optional): is a string[] that contains the aliases of the [canvas component](/start/canvas-components) that will be removed after the movement. You can read more about it [here](#alias-to-remove-after-property).
* `tickerAliasToResume` (Optional): in case you want to continue some tickers that were previously paused, you can pass the aliases of the canvas components that have the tickers to be resumed. You can read more about it [here](#ticker-alias-to-resume-property).

## Rotate

For rotating a canvas component you can use the `RotateTicker` class.
This Ticker edit the `rotation` property of the [canvas component](/start/canvas-components).
It is possible to start rotation on all [canvas component](/start/canvas-components).

`RotateTicker` have a constructor that takes the a object with the following properties:

* `speed`: is a number that represents the speed of the rotation. default is `0.01`.
* `clockwise`: is a boolean that represents the direction of the rotation. if `true` the rotation is clockwise, if `false` the rotation is counterclockwise. default is `true`.
* `speedProgression`: is a [`TickerProgrationType`](/start/tickers). default is `undefined`.
* `startOnlyIfHaveTexture`: is a boolean that represents if the animation should start only if the canvas component have a texture not empty. default is `false`.

for example:

```typescript
const texture = await Assets.load('https://pixijs.com/assets/eggHead.png');
const alien = Sprite.from(texture);
alien.anchor.set(0.5);
canvas.add("alien", alien);

// in this example we rotate the canvas component "alien" with a speed of 0.2
canvas.addTicker("alien", new RotateTicker({ speed: 0.2 }));
```

```typescript
const texture = await Assets.load('https://pixijs.com/assets/eggHead.png');
const alien = Sprite.from(texture);
alien.anchor.set(0.5);
canvas.add("alien", alien);

// in this example we rotate the canvas component "alien" with a speed of 0.2 and counterclockwise
canvas.addTicker("alien", new RotateTicker({ speed: 0.2, clockwise: false }, 2))
```

```typescript
const texture = await Assets.load('https://pixijs.com/assets/eggHead.png');
const alien = Sprite.from(texture);
alien.anchor.set(0.5);
canvas.add("alien", alien);

// in this example the canvas component "alien" will rotate with a speed of 0 and the speed will increase linearly until it reaches 0.5
canvas.addTicker("alien", new RotateTicker({ speed: 0, speedProgression: { type: "linear", amt: 0.001, limit: 0.5 } }))
```

## Fade

For fading a canvas component you can use the `FadeAlphaTicker` class.
This Ticker edit the `alpha` property of the [canvas component](/start/canvas-components).
It is possible to start fading on all [canvas component](/start/canvas-components).

`FadeAlphaTicker` have a constructor that takes the a object with the following properties:

* `duration`: is a number that represents the duration of the fade. default is `1`.
* `type`: it can be `hide` or `show`. if `hide` the canvas component will disappear, if `show` the canvas component will appear. default is `show`.
* `limit`: is a number that represents the limit of the fade. default is `1` if `type` is `show` and `0` if `type` is `hide`.
* `startOnlyIfHaveTexture`: is a boolean that represents if the animation should start only if the canvas component have a texture not empty. default is `false`.
* `aliasToRemoveAfter`: is a string[] that contains the aliases of the [canvas component](/start/canvas-components) that will be removed after the fade. default is `[]`.

for example:

```typescript
const texture = await Assets.load('https://pixijs.com/assets/eggHead.png');
const alien = Sprite.from(texture);
alien.alpha = 0;
canvas.add("alien", alien);

// in this example we fade the canvas component "alien" with a duration of 2 seconds
canvas.addTicker("alien", new FadeAlphaTicker({ duration: 2 }));
```

## Multiple asserts
