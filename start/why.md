# Why Pixi’VN?

The reason why Pixi’VN was born is that the current systems for creating visual novels or 2D RPGs are based on old systems and have many shortcomings.

Pixi’VN combines the development of various 2D games in a single engine, bringing video game development closer to web applications in order to take advantage of their great compatibility and cloud services.

## What is Pixi’VN?

Pixi’VN is a very versatile and powerful visual novel/2D game engine. It is based on JavaScript/TypeScript and uses the [PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/) library for rendering.

Pixi’VN provides the ability to use [project templates](/start/getting-started.md#pivivn-templates) to get started quickly. Less experienced developers can use these templates to create a visual novel without much knowledge of JavaScript/TypeScript.

You have the option to use various types of narrative languages ​​(in addition to JavaScript/TypeScript). Currently you can use the following:

* [*ink*](/ink/ink.md)
* [Ren'Py](/renpy/renpy.md)

## Features of Pixi’VN

Its great **versatility** is due to the fact that Pixi’VN is an npm package, and not a framework. This means that it can be installed on any Node.js project, coupled with your favorite JavaScript framework (React, Vue, Angular, etc.) and use the provided features (even if only partially) for a specific purpose, which can be for example the creation of a visual novel or another type of 2D game (such as Point and Click Adventure Games, RPGs, etc...), use only the narrative features in a 3D game, display an animation in a website etc...

In order to be as **light** as possible, it only deals with the following essential features:
* narrative management
* providing a 2D soundtrack
* providing functionality to play sounds and music
* providing a storage device to save the game loadable
* saves the current state of the entire game at each "story step" also giving the possibility to go back
* functionality to save and load the current state of the game.

It does **not reinvent things** that already exist. Pixi’VN binds together several very popular libraries and provides APIs to interact with them and have full access to them. It does not invent new programming/narrative languages.

## Ren'Py vs Pixi’VN

Making a comparison between Ren'Py and Pixi’VN is necessary because Ren'Py is currently the most widely used engine for creating visual novels.

(This comparison was made by the Pixi’VN team, trying to be unbiased. If you disagree with this comparison or if you think other features should be compared, create an [new discussion](https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/pixi-vn/discussions/categories/wiki).)

**What is Ren'Py?**

Ren'Py is a visual novel engine – used by thousands of creators from around the world – that helps you use words, images, and sounds to tell interactive stories that run on computers and mobile devices. These can be both visual novels and life simulation games.

* Programming language: `Ren'Py language`, a programming language that allows you to develop visual novels without much knowledge and very quickly. It is based on Python.
* Canvas library: [`Pygame_sdl2`](https://github.com/renpy/pygame_sdl2) is a reimplementation of the Pygame API using SDL2 and related libraries. While in the past it was meant to support multiple applications, it only saw adoption as technology underlying Ren'Py, and is currently being supported for that purpose.
* How does it work: Ren'Py is a complete visual novel engine/framework that takes care of creating a project, executing it, distributing it, and much more.

### Programming language

Ren'Py uses its own language, `Ren'Py language`, which is based on superset of Python. You can use Python statements in Ren'Py language.

Pixi’VN uses JavaScript/TypeScript, which is a very powerful and popular language. To write narrative instead of using a specific language, you can use various narrative languages ​​(with the [PixiVNJson](/other-topics/pixi-vn-json.md)).

| Programming language | Ren'Py | Pixi’VN |
|---|---|---|
| Ease of learning | It is intended for people who do not know how to program | You can use templates to get started, but as you progress with development you will need basic knowledge of JavaScript/TypeScript, NodeJS and npm |
| Is it a typed language? | ❌ (Using Python you can use types, but the Ren'Py compiler does not have type checking. Also, much of the native Ren'Py code does not use types.) | ✅ |
| Can you use the debug? | ❌ | ✅ |
| Package/libraries manager | ❌ | npm |
| Narrative Language | Ren'Py language and Python Statements | JavaScript/TypeScript and various narrative languages ​​(including Ren'Py language) |
| Mini-games implementation  | You can use Ren'Py Creator-Defined Displayables (CDD) | You can use PixiJS or install other libraries |
| UI implementation | You can use Ren'Py screens | You can use PixiJS, React, Vue, Angular, etc. |
| UI components | You can use components provided by Ren'Py. They are usually based on images. | Depending on the UI framework you choose, you can use the component library you prefer. For example Material-UI, Bootstrap, PixiJS UI, etc. |

#### Dialogues implementation

In Ren'Py, for creating dialogues, you need to use the `Ren'Py language`. This language is very simple and easy to learn. It is based on Python and you can use Python statements in Ren'Py language.

In Pixi’VN, you can use JavaScript/TypeScript to create dialogues. You can also use various narrative languages ​​(potentially you can integrate any narrative language using [PixiVNJson](/other-topics/pixi-vn-json.md)).

Example of Ren'Py:

```renpy [start.rpy]
label start:
    "Hello, world!"
    "This is a Pixi’VN tutorial."
    "I hope you enjoy it!"
```

Example of Pixi’VN:

```typescript [startLabel.ts]
const startLabel = newLabel("start_label_id", [
    (props) => narration.dialogue = "Hello, world!",
    (props) => narration.dialogue = "This is a Pixi’VN tutorial.",
    (props) => narration.dialogue = "I hope you enjoy it!"
])
```

```ink [start.ink]
=== start
Hello, world!
This is a Pixi’VN tutorial.
I hope you enjoy it!
->DONE
```

```renpy [start.rpy]
label start:
    "Hello, world!"
    "This is a Pixi’VN tutorial."
    "I hope you enjoy it!"
```

#### Minigame implementation

In Ren'Py, for creating minigames with complex mechanics/animations, you need to use the [`Creator-Defined Displayables (CDD)`](https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/cdd.html), this is necessary because otherwise you will have big performance problems. With CDD you can create/control one or more graphic elements through a render loop.
CDD is not very intuitive and complicated to use. There are very few examples and few developers using CDD. In fact, most of the minigames do not have complex logic and animations.

In Pixi’VN, you can use PixiJS to create minigames. PixiJS is a very powerful library that allows you to create complex animations and mechanics. The documentation and examples are very detailed and there are many developers using PixiJS.

You can try some Ren'py and PIxiJS minigames to understand the difference:

* Ren'Py minigames: <https://itch.io/game-assets/free/tag-minigames/tag-renpy>
* PixiJS minigames: <https://github.com/pixijs/open-games>
* PixiJS tutorials: <https://pixijs.com/8.x/tutorials>

#### UI implementation

In Ren'Py, for creating the UI, you need to create screens and styles. The most recommended implementation is to create a series of images that are positioned within the canvas across graphic components. The graphic components are very few, limiting and not very intuitive.

In Pixi’VN, in addition to being able to use the components of PixiJS, you can also use systems such as React, Vue, Angular, etc. and install component libraries such as Material-UI, Bootstrap, etc. This allows you to create much more complex UI screens with excellent performance.

### Performance and project size

The performance and size of the project are very important factors to consider when choosing a framework.

**Canvas libraries used:**

* [`Pygame_sdl2`](https://github.com/renpy/pygame_sdl2): This canvas is absolutely underperforming. This can be tested by inserting more moving graphic elements into Ren'py.
* PixiJS: It is based on more modern systems and has great performance. This can be tested directly from this example:

<sandbox
  template="jrlkrt"
  entry="/src/labels/startLabel.ts"
/>

**UI performance:**

* Ren'Py's UI is based on canvas components that use images within the project.
* In Pixi’VN you can use HTML and/or JavaScript frameworks, known for their performance and usability, or the canvas. HTML/JavaScript components are not necessarily based on images, which leads to a smaller project size.

**Project size:**

* The entire UI of Ren'py is based on "physical images" and this makes the size of the project very large.
* In a Pixi’VN project, you can choose whether and which graphics component library to use the canvas with a "physical images". Being a library it does not determine the size of the project, but if you use [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) or other tools, the size of the project will be very small.

### Device distribution

Ren'Py framework is directly responsible for distributing the game on various devices.

Pixi’VN does not deal with distributing the project. You can use various frameworks (Tauri, Electron, Cordova, etc...) to distribute the project on various devices. Pixi’VN provides templates that already include the necessary configurations for distribution.

| Device Distribution | Ren'Py | Pixi’VN |
|---|---|---|
| Ease of use | It's **very simple**. You can use an Ren'Py UI to create the package | For less experienced users, it **can be difficult** to set up the project so that it can be distributed on multiple devices. Using templates can simplify this step. |
| Package Configurations | Essential | Very complete. (You can choose if the package should be installed and run without an installation) |
| Deployment automations with github action or gitlab pipeline | ❌ | ✅ |
| System notification | ❌ | ✅ |
| Use connected devices (Camera, Flashlight etc...) | ❌ | ✅ |
| UI scaling based on device type | ✅ | ✅ |
| UI scaling to fit screen size | ❌ | ✅ |
| Windows/Linux/Mac OS | ✅ (using Ren'Py) | ✅ (using Tauri, Electron, Cordova, etc...) |
| Android/iOS | ✅ (using Ren'Py) | ✅ (using Ionic or Cordova) |
| Web | ✅ (is in beta) | ✅ (is natively supported) |
| Xbox/PlayStation/Nintendo Switch | ✅ (using Sen’py) | Only with Xbox with UWP |

### Development possibilities

Ren'Py is a engine designed only for creating visual novels. Adding complex functionality through Python that goes beyond the development of a normal visual novel is very complicated and is not recommended by the Ren'Py team. It does not have package/library manager.

Pixi’VN is an [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) library that allows you to create visual novels. So if you want you can use this library in a project that is not natively a visual novel. [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is a package manager for JavaScript and the world's largest software registry.

### Longevity and ease of internal development

Ren'py born in 2004 and is still used today. It is a very stable and mature project.
Ren'Py in addition to including the development of its own library for visual novels also includes the development of `Ren'Py language` and `Pygame_sdl2`. Furthermore, since it also deals with distributing the project on various devices, this means that Ren'Py must also keep the system updated based on the devices on which it is distributed.

This means that keeping Ren'Py updated is a constant and very complex process that "touches" many types of programming (Parsing, Graphics, etc...).

Pixi’VN born in 2024. It is a very young project.
Pixi’VN is only a library that uses PixiJS for the canvas. As well as providing functionality for visual novels, it doesn't care about anything else.

This means that keeping Pixi’VN updated is a very simple process and once it reaches a stable version it will not need constant updates to be compatible with the latest devices.

### Conclusion

Finally my personal conclusion is that, you know object-oriented programming and you want to create a visual novel with various features (minigames, etc...) you should use Pixi’VN. If you are not a programmer and you want to create a visual novel quickly and easily, you can use Ren'Py.
