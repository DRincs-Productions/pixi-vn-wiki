# Filters

Having the ability to filter the entire canvas or a specific component can be very useful in many cases.

The [PixiJS Filters](https://pixijs.io/filters/docs/) library provides this capability to PixiJS.

Currently, this functionality is not available in Pixiâ€™VN, but we plan to implement it. Add a like or comment to [this discussion](https://github.com/DRincs-Productions/pixi-vn/discussions/286) to show your interest in this feature.
