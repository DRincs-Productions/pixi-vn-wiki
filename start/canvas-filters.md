# Filters

Having the ability to filter the entire canvas or a specific component can be very useful in many cases.

The AAA library provides this capability to PixiJS.

Currently, this functionality is not available in Pixi'VN, but we plan to implement it. Add a like or comment to this discussion to show your interest in this feature.

this library adds a visual filter to the entire Canvas.

You should create a library that allows you to use this component in Pixi'VN (components designed for PixiJS do not have functionality to save their current state and then restore it with a save). ->Â <https://pixi-vn.web.app/start/canvas-elements.html#custom-elements>
