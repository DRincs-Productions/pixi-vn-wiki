# Narration

The narrative is the set of [dialogues](/start/dialogue.md), [choices](/start/choices.md) and [input requests](/start/input.md) shown to the player as the game progresses.

With Pixi’VN, you have the option to use various types of narrative languages. You can also switch from one language to another to take advantage of the features of each one.

* **JavaScript/TypeScript** is a programming language. You can use it to write your narrative, but it will lead you to write a lot of code. It has the advantage that it can access all functions of the project.
* **[*ink*](/ink/ink.md)** is a narrative language that allows you to write a narrative easily, without having to write a lot of code.
* **[Ren'Py](/renpy/renpy.md)** is a narrative language that allows you to write a narrative easily, without having to write a lot of code.
