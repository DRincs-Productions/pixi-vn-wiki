# Articulated animations and effects

The articulated animations and effects are functions that can be used to perform complex animations and effects. They combine more [primitive animations and effects (Tickers)](/start/canvas-tickers.md) to create a more complex animation or effect. For example, the `Shake` function is an articulated animation that uses more `MoveTicker` to create a shake effect.
