# Interface with JavaScript Framework

Pixiâ€™VN offers the possibility of adding an HTML Element with the same dimensions as the [PixiJS Canvas](/start/canvas-elements.md) to add an **interface** with JavaScript frameworks.

By "Interface" is meant the elements that are above the canvas, such as buttons, forms, etc.

This allows the use of systems such as React, Vue, Angular, etc. to create much more complex **interface screens** with excellent performance.

* [React Interface](/start/interface-react.md)
* [Vue](/start/interface-vue.md)

## How navigate/switch between interface screens?

To switch between interface screens (without interrupting the canvas), you can use popups and modals, or navigate between different routes.
For navigate between different url paths/routes you should read: [What is the URL Path and Routes?](/other/various-answers#what-is-the-url-path-and-routes).

## How to enable HTML interaction?

By default, all HTML elements of the interface have the `pointer-events: none` style.
The reason is that because the html interface is above the canvas, all clicks are intercepted by the interface and not by the canvas.

So you must set the `pointer-events: auto` style only for the elements (example a button, a form, etc...) that you want to interact with the user.
