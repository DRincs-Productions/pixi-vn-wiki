## Performance
I imagine the performance of the Ren'py and Pixi'VM libraries to be almost the same,
but the performance of the Canvas used by the two libraries is very significant.
- Pygame_sdl2: This canvas is absolutely underperforming. This can be tested by inserting more moving graphic elements into Renpy.
- PixiJS: It is based on more modern systems and has great performance. This can be tested directly from an example made by PixiJS: [Exemple](https://pixijs.com/examples/basic/cache-as-bitmap)
