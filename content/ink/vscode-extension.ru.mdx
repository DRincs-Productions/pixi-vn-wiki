title: VS Code Extension
---

If you're using Ink, we recommend using the Ink extension we developed. In addition to providing the basic functionality of the Ink language extensions, you can select pixi-vn as your game engine and test your narration in real time.

Here's the recommended settings file:

```json title="settings.json"
{
    "ink.mainFile": "start.ink",
    "ink.rootFolder": "src/ink",
    "ink.markup": "Markdown",
    "ink.engine": "pixi-vn",
}
```
