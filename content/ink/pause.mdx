title: Using pause in ink
---
import { PauseExample } from "@/components/ink-examples";

After executing a # script the system does a <DynamicLink href="/start/labels-flow#next-step">go next</DynamicLink> to move to the next steps. For example in this case you will see the image and the dialogue text.

```ink
=== start ===
# image add "image" /image.jpg
Hello, world!
-> DONE
```

You can use the `pause` to stop the execution of the steps and set the dialogue text to empty.

The syntax is as follows:

`#` + `pause`

```ink tab="ink/start.ink"
=== start ===
# image add alien eggHead
# pause
Hello, world!
-> DONE
```

```ts tab="assets/manifest.ts"
import { AssetsManifest } from "@drincs/pixi-vn";

/**
 * Manifest for the assets used in the game.
 * You can read more about the manifest here: https://pixijs.com/8.x/guides/components/assets#loading-multiple-assets
 */
const manifest: AssetsManifest = {
    bundles: [
        {
            name: "start",
            assets: [
                {
                    alias: "eggHead",
                    src: "https://pixijs.com/assets/eggHead.png",
                },
            ],
        },
    ],
};
export default manifest;
```
