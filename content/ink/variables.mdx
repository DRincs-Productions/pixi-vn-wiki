<Callout type="info">

You can read more about using variables in ink on the [official documentation](https://github.com/inkle/ink/blob/master/Documentation/WritingWithInk#part-3-variables-and-logic).

</Callout>

***ink*** also supports variables, both temporary and global, storing numerical and content data, or even story flow commands. It is fully-featured in terms of logic, and contains a few additional structures to help keep the often complex logic of a branching story better organised.

In the ***ink* + Pixi’VN integration**, the variables `VAR` and `CONST` are equivalent to <DynamicLink href="/start/storage">variables in storage</DynamicLink>. And the variables `temp` are equivalent to <DynamicLink href="/start/storage#temporary-storage">temporary variables in storage</DynamicLink>.

Just like in **native *ink*** you can use variables in dialogs or `scripts that start with #`.

The name of the ***ink*** variables corresponds to the key of a variable in the <DynamicLink href="/start/storage">storage</DynamicLink>.

So For example, if you have the following ***ink*** code:

```ink title="ink"
VAR myVariable = 42
```

You can access the variable `myVariable` in the <DynamicLink href="/start/storage">storage</DynamicLink> with the following code:

```typescript
import { storage } from '@drincs/pixi-vn'

const myVariable = storage.get<number>("myVariable");
```

Or vice versa, if you have the following code:

```typescript
import { storage } from '@drincs/pixi-vn'

storage.set("myDuration", 42);
```

You can access the variable `myDuration` in the ***ink*** code with the following code:

```ink title="ink"
// this is used to avoid the ink error, because the variable is not defined
VAR myDuration = 0

=== start ===
The value of myDuration is: {myDuration}
# show image bg /image.png dissolve duration {myDuration}
-> DONE
```
