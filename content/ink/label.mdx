What is a **`knot`**? As explained in the [official documentation](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/web-tutorial/), the story is comprised of multiple linked sections which we call `knots` in ***ink* terminology**. The start of a `knot` is indicated in ***ink*** using at least two equals signs the left hand side `knot`'s name, and optionally on the right too (so for example `=== london ===`).

Are there differences between `label` and `knot`? No, they are the same thing. In Pixi’VN, when you create a `knot` with ***ink***, a `label` will be created internally and saved in the registry.

## Run a knot

To run a `knot` you can use the following methods:

<Accordions>

<Accordion title="-> (jump)" id="->">

You can start a `knot` using the `->` symbol. It corresponds to the <DynamicLink href="/start/labels#jump-to-a-label">`jump` functionality</DynamicLink> in the Pixi’VN library.

Write the `->` symbol followed by the name of the knot, for example:

```ink
=== start ===
Start
-> after // [!code focus]

=== after ===
After
End
-> DONE
```

<NativeJumpExample />

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="<- (call)" id="<-">

You can start a `knot` using the `->` symbol. It corresponds to the <DynamicLink href="/start/labels#call-to-a-label">`call` functionality</DynamicLink> in the Pixi’VN library.

Write the `<-` symbol followed by the name of the knot, for example:

```ink
== start ==
I had a headache; threading is hard to get your head around.
<- conversation
<- walking


== conversation ==
It was a tense moment for Monty and me.
 * "What did you have for lunch today?"[] I asked.
    "Spam and eggs," he replied.
 * "Nice weather, we're having,"[] I said.
    "I've seen better," he replied.
 - -> house

== walking ==
We continued to walk down the dusty road.
 * [Continue walking]
    -> house

== house ==
Before long, we arrived at his house.
-> DONE
```

<NativeCallExample />

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="# jump (deprecated)" id="jump">

<Callout title="Deprecated" type="warn">

Since it is no longer recommended to use Inky, but the [Ink extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=drincs-productions.pixi-vn-ink-vscode) for VS Code, the `# jump` script is now deprecated. It is recommended to use the native `->` symbol instead, which is supported by the Ink extension.

</Callout>

You can start a `knot` using the `# jump`. Write `# jump` followed by the name of the `knot`, for example:

```ink tab="ink/start.ink"
=== start ===
Start
# jump javascript_label_id // [!code focus]
Start End
-> DONE
```

```ts tab="labels/javascriptLabel.ts"
import { narration, newLabel } from "@drincs/pixi-vn";

const javascriptLabel = newLabel("javascript_label_id", [
    () => {
        narration.dialogue = "After";
    },
    () => {
        narration.dialogue = "After End";
    },
]);
export default javascriptLabel;
```

```ts tab="index.tsx"
// Remember to import the label file at least once into your project. // [!code focus]
import "./labels/javascriptLabel"; // [!code focus]

// ...
```

<JumpExample />

This feature has been added by ***ink* + Pixi’VN integration**.

`# jump` is equivalent to the `->` symbol. The difference is that this script is ignored by **Inky**, so you can use it to call a `knot` written in another narrative language or Javascript/TypeScript without **Inky** warning you that the `knot` does not exist.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="# call (deprecated)" id="call">

<Callout title="Deprecated" type="warn">

Since it is no longer recommended to use Inky, but the [Ink extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=drincs-productions.pixi-vn-ink-vscode) for VS Code, the `# call` script is now deprecated. It is recommended to use the native `<-` symbol instead, which is supported by the Ink extension.

</Callout>

The **native *ink* language** does not have a possibility to <DynamicLink href="/start/labels#call-a-label">"call" a `knot`</DynamicLink> without close the current `knot` and open the new one. This is why the ***ink* + Pixi’VN integration** introduces the `# call` script. This script is ignored by **Inky**.

Write `# call` followed by the name of the `knot`, for example:

```ink tab="ink/start.ink"
=== start ===
Start
# call after // [!code focus]
Start End
-> DONE

=== after ===
After
End
-> DONE
```
