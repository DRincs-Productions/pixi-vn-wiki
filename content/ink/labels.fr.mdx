What is a **`knot`**? As explained in the [official documentation](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/web-tutorial/), the story is comprised of multiple linked sections which we call `knots` in **_ink_ terminology**. The start of a `knot` is indicated in **_ink_** using at least two equals signs the left hand side `knot`'s name, and optionally on the right too (so for example `=== london ===`).

Are there differences between `label` and `knot`? No, they are the same thing. In Pixi’VN, when you create a `knot` with **_ink_**, a `label` will be created internally and saved in the registry.

## Run a knot

To run a `knot` you can use the following methods:

<Accordions>

<Accordion title="ink_jump" id="jump">

You can execute a `knot` using the `->` symbol. It corresponds to the <DynamicLink href="/start/labels#jump-to-a-label">`jump` functionality</DynamicLink> in the Pixi’VN library.

Write the `->` symbol followed by the name of the `knot`, for example:

```ink title="ink"
=== start ===
Start
-> after // [!code focus]

=== after ===
After
End
-> DONE
```

<NativeJumpExample />

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="ink_call" id="call">

You can execute a `knot` using the `->` symbol. It corresponds to the <DynamicLink href="/start/labels#call-to-a-label">`call` functionality</DynamicLink> in the Pixi’VN library.

Write the `<-` symbol followed by the name of the `knot`, for example:

```ink title="ink"
== start ==
I had a headache; threading is hard to get your head around.
<- conversation // [!code focus]
<- walking // [!code focus]


== conversation ==
It was a tense moment for Monty and me.
 * "What did you have for lunch today?"[] I asked.
    "Spam and eggs," he replied.
 * "Nice weather, we're having,"[] I said.
    "I've seen better," he replied.
 - -> house

== walking ==
We continued to walk down the dusty road.
 * [Continue walking]
    -> house

== house ==
Before long, we arrived at his house.
-> DONE
```
