<Callout title="VS Code" type="warn">

If you are using VS Code, consider installing the [Ink extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=drincs-productions.pixi-vn-ink-vscode) for syntax highlighting and basic support for ink files. It has a setting to put the engine, so you can set it to `pixi-vn` to avoid warnings for Pixi’VN-specific features.

</Callout>

**Inky** is the official editor for _ink_ scripts, developed by Inkle (the creators of _ink_). Download it from [the official site](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/).

## なぜこれを使うのか？

Writing and testing your narrative in Inky is much faster than running your own web project. Inky gives you a clear overview of all branching paths and story logic.

<Callout type="info">

Pixi’VN-specific features (such as character sprites, backgrounds, music, etc.) are ignored in Inky.

</Callout>

To use Inky, create a file named `main.ink` in your project and include the ink file you want to run. Then open `main.ink` in Inky.

```ink title="main.ink"
INCLUDE ink/start.ink
-> start
```
