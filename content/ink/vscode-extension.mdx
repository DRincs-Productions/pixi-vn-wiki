If you're using Ink, we recommend using the Ink extension we developed. In addition to providing standard *ink* language features, it lets you select `pixi-vn` as your game engine and test your narration in real time.

You can download it and get more information [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=drincs-productions.pixi-vn-ink-vscode).
