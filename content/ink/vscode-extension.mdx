If you're using Ink, we recommend using the Ink extension we developed. In addition to providing the basic functionality of the *ink* language extensions, you can select pixi-vn as your game engine and test your narration in real time.

You can download it and get more information [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=drincs-productions.pixi-vn-ink-vscode).

Here's the recommended settings file:

```json title="settings.json"
{
    "ink.mainFile": "start.ink",
    "ink.rootFolder": "src/ink",
    "ink.markup": "Markdown",
    "ink.engine": "pixi-vn",
}
```
