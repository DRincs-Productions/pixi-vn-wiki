  Learn how to integrate the ink scripting language with Pixi’VN to write interactive narratives, import ink files, and use advanced features in your visual novel projects.

import { InkExample } from "@/components/ink-examples";
import { Accordion, Accordions } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/accordion';

Pixi’VN lets you write interactive narratives using **_ink_**, a scripting language designed for branching stories.

**What is _ink_?** **_ink_** is a simple scripting language for interactive stories, used in games like 80 Days, Heaven's Vault, and Sorcery! Learn more on the [_ink_ website](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/).

The **_ink_ + Pixi’VN integration** uses [inkjs](https://github.com/inkle/inkjs) and <DynamicLink href="/other-topics/pixi-vn-json">PixiVNJson</DynamicLink> to parse **_ink_ code** and generate JSON that Pixi’VN can interpret. This means JavaScript/TypeScript and **_ink_** share the same storage and canvas, and you can launch **_ink_** `knots` (or `labels`) from JavaScript/TypeScript and vice versa. You get the best of both worlds: write narration in **_ink_**, and use JavaScript/TypeScript for minigames or advanced animations.

```ink title="ink/start.ink"
=== start ===
We arrived into London at 9.45pm exactly.

* "There is not a moment to lose!"[] I declared.
 -> hurry_outside

* "Monsieur, let us savour this moment!"[] I declared.
 My master clouted me firmly around the head and dragged me out of the door.
 -> dragged_outside

* [We hurried home] -> hurry_outside

=== hurry_outside ===
We hurried home to Savile Row -> as_fast_as_we_could

=== dragged_outside ===
He insisted that we hurried home to Savile Row
-> as_fast_as_we_could

=== as_fast_as_we_could ===
<> as fast as we could.
-> start
```

## Why?

Writing narrative directly in **JavaScript/TypeScript** can be slow and complex, especially for beginners. **_ink_** is much easier to learn and write.

New developers can start with an <DynamicLink href="/start#project-initialization">_ink_ template</DynamicLink>, then gradually learn JavaScript/TypeScript for advanced features.

## 安装

<Callout title="Templates" type="info">

Starting a new Pixi’VN project? Use a <DynamicLink href="/start#project-initialization">template</DynamicLink> that already includes _ink_.

</Callout>

To install the _ink_ package in an existing JavaScript project, use one of the following commands:

```sh tab="npm"
npm install @drincs/pixi-vn @drincs/pixi-vn-ink
```

```sh tab="yarn"
yarn add @drincs/pixi-vn @drincs/pixi-vn-ink
```

```sh tab="pnpm"
pnpm add @drincs/pixi-vn @drincs/pixi-vn-ink
```

```sh tab="bun"
bun add @drincs/pixi-vn @drincs/pixi-vn-ink
```

```sh tab="deno"
deno install npm:@drincs/pixi-vn npm:@drincs/pixi-vn-ink
```

### 初始化

After installing, use `importInkText()` to load your **_ink_ script**:

```typescript title="main.ts"
import { importInkText } from '@drincs/pixi-vn-ink'

const inkText = `
=== start ===
Hello
-> END
`

importInkText([inkText, ...])
```

Now you can run an **_ink_ `knot`** (or `label`) using <DynamicLink href="/start/labels#run-a-label">Pixi’VN functions</DynamicLink>:

```typescript title="main.ts"
import { narration } from '@drincs/pixi-vn'

narration.callLabel(`start`, {})
```

<Accordions>

<Accordion title="Import text from .ink files" id="import-ink-files">

<Callout type="info">

This guide uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), but the same logic applies elsewhere.

</Callout>

To import `.ink` files, you need to configure your project to handle them as text files.

Below are the steps to do this:

- Declare the `*.ink` module in `ink.d.ts`.
- Add `.ink` to `assetsInclude` in `vite.config.ts`.
- Import the file with `?raw` to get its text content.

```ts tab="main.ts"
import { importInkText } from '@drincs/pixi-vn-ink'
import startLabel from './ink/start.ink?raw'

importInkText([startLabel, ...])
```

```ts tab="vite.config.ts"
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  assetsInclude: ['**/*.ink'],
})
```

```ts tab="ink.d.ts"
declare module '*.ink' {
    const value: string
    export default value
}
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Import all .ink files from a folder" id="import-ink-folder">

<Callout type="info">

This guide uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), but the same logic applies elsewhere.

</Callout>

To import multiple `.ink` files, use `import.meta.glob`:

```ts tab="utils/ink-utility.ts"
import { convertInkText, importInkText } from "@drincs/pixi-vn-ink";

async function getInkText() {
    const files = import.meta.glob<string>("../ink/*.ink", { query: "?raw", import: "default" });
    return await Promise.all(
        Object.values(files).map(async (importFile) => {
            return await importFile();
        })
    );
}

export async function importAllInkLabels() {
    let fileEntries = await getInkText();
    await importInkText(fileEntries);
}

export async function convertInkToJson() {
    let fileEntries = await getInkText();
    return await Promise.all(fileEntries.map((data) => convertInkText(data)));
}
```

```ts tab="vite.config.ts"
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  assetsInclude: ['**/*.ink'],
})
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Vite.js plugin" id="vite-plugin">

For a better developer experience, use the Vite plugin:

```ts tab="vite.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import { noHmrInkPlugin } from '@drincs/pixi-vn-ink/vite'
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  plugins: [
    noHmrInkPlugin()
  ]
})
```

```ts tab="main.ts"
import { setupInkHmrListener } from '@drincs/pixi-vn-ink/vite-listener'

setupInkHmrListener()
```

</Accordion>

</Accordions>

## Syntax ignored by Pixi’VN

Some _ink_ syntax is ignored by Pixi’VN. You can use these in your **_ink_ script** (e.g., for testing in Inky editor), but Pixi’VN will ignore them.

### INCLUDE

`INCLUDE` is an _ink_ directive to include another _ink_ file. In Pixi’VN, you should use `importInkText()` to load multiple _ink_ files instead, so `INCLUDE` is ignored.

### Narration outside the `knots`

Narration outside the `knots` (or `labels`) is ignored, except for variables.

For example:

```ink title="ink"
VAR my_var = false // ✅ This will be handled (because it is a variable)
Hello // ❌ This will be ignored  [!code warning]
-> start // ❌ This will be ignored [!code warning]
=== start === // ✅ This will be handled
My name is John // ✅ This will be handled
-> DONE // ✅ This will be handled
```

## Differences between native _ink_ and Pixi’VN _ink_

- in this case:

  ```ink title="ink"
  { shuffle:
    -  2 of Diamonds.
      'You lose this time!' crowed the croupier.
  }
  ```

    **In native _ink_**, you will see two different dialogues, the first one will be `2 of Diamonds.` and the second one will be `'You lose this time!' crowed the croupier.`.

    **In Pixi’VN _ink_**, you will not see two different dialogues, but the following dialogue: `2 of Diamonds.\n\n'You lose this time!' crowed the croupier.`. In <DynamicLink href="/ink/markup#markdown-on-ink">Markdown</DynamicLink> it will be displayed like this:

  ```txt
  2 of Diamonds.
  'You lose this time!' crowed the croupier.
  ```

- if a `weave` (in following example `shove`) is attached to a one time choice, and it is opened with `-> shove` it will not invalidate the one time choice. To invalidate it you will have to select the choice as usual.

    Here is an example:

  ```ink title="ink"
  -> start
  === start ===
  * [1] -> shove
  * (shove) [2] 2
  * {shove} [3] -> END
  -  -> start
  -> DONE
  ```

    In case you take choice `1`, the second time it will be opened `start`:

  - if you use **native _ink_**, you will only be able to choose choice `3`. The choice `2` is hidden because being "one time" **native _ink_** will know that you have already made this decision with `-> shove`.
  - if you use **Pixi’VN _ink_**, you will be able to choose choice `2` or `3`. The choice `2` is not hidden because **Pixi’VN _ink_** doesn't know that `shove` is paired with a choice.

  To get the same logic as `start` both in **native _ink_** and **Pixi’VN _ink_** you will have to write the following code:

  ```ink title="ink"
  -> start
  === start ===
  * [1] -> shove
  * (shove) {!shove} [2] 2
  * {shove} [3] -> END
  -  -> start
  -> DONE
  ```
