## Why?

Writing and testing your narrative in Inky is much faster than running your own web project. Inky gives you a clear overview of all branching paths and story logic.

Pixiâ€™VN-specific features (such as character sprites, backgrounds, music, etc.) are ignored in Inky.

To use Inky, create a file named `main.ink` in your project and include the ink file you want to run. Then open `main.ink` in Inky.

<Callout title="Templates" type="info">

In all templates, a basic `main.ink` file is already included. You can start writing your story right away.

```ink title="main.ink"
INCLUDE ink/start.ink
-> start
```
