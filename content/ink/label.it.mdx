What is a **knot**? As explained in the [official documentation](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/web-tutorial/), the story is comprised of multiple linked sections which we call `knots` in **_ink_ terminology**. The start of a knot is indicated in **_ink_** using at least two equals signs the left hand side knot's name, and optionally on the right too (so for example `=== london ===`).

Are there differences between `labels` and `knots`? No, they are the same thing. In Pixi’VN, when you create a `knot` with **_ink_**, a label will be created internally and saved in the registry.

## Run a knot

To run a knot you can use the following methods:

<Accordions>

<Accordion title="->" id="->">

You can start a knot using the `->` symbol. Write the `->` symbol followed by the name of the knot, for example:

```ink
=== start ===
Start
-> after // [!code focus]

=== after ===
After
End
-> DONE
```

<NativeJumpExample />

This feature derives from **native _ink_** and is the only native method to start a knot. So, if you test your script using **Inky**, you will be able to use this feature.

It corresponds to the <DynamicLink href="/start/labels#jump-to-a-label">`jump` functionality</DynamicLink> in the Pixi’VN library.

As said before you can use the `->` symbol to call a knot written in another narrative language or Javascript/TypeScript, but if you're using **Inky** to test your script, **Inky** will warn you that the knot does not exist (because **Inky** analyzes only the `.ink` file).

It is for this very reason that the need for a new script arises which is ignored by **Inky** but is handled by Pixi’VN. This script is the `# jump`.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="# jump" id="jump">

You can start a knot using the `# jump`. Write `# jump` followed by the name of the knot, for example:

```ink tab="ink/start.ink"
=== start ===
Start
# jump javascript_label_id // [!code focus]
Start End
-> DONE
```

```ts tab="labels/javascriptLabel.ts"
import { narration, newLabel } from "@drincs/pixi-vn";

const javascriptLabel = newLabel("javascript_label_id", [
    () => {
        narration.dialogue = "After";
    },
    () => {
        narration.dialogue = "After End";
    },
]);
export default javascriptLabel;
```

```ts tab="App.tsx"
// Remember to import the label file at least once into your project. // [!code focus]
import "./labels/javascriptLabel"; // [!code focus]

// ...
```

<JumpExample />

This feature has been added by **_ink_ + Pixi’VN integration**.

`# jump` is equivalent to the `->` symbol. The difference is that this script is ignored by **Inky**, so you can use it to call a knot written in another narrative language or Javascript/TypeScript without **Inky** warning you that the knot does not exist.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="# call" id="call">

The **native _ink_ language** does not have a possibility to <DynamicLink href="/start/labels#call-a-label">"call" a knot</DynamicLink> without close the current knot and open the new one. This is why the **_ink_ + Pixi’VN integration** introduces the `# call` script. This script is ignored by **Inky**.

Write `# call` followed by the name of the knot, for example:

```ink tab="ink/start.ink"
=== start ===
Start
# call after // [!code focus]
Start End
-> DONE

=== after ===
After
End
-> DONE
```

<CallExample />

</Accordion>

</Accordions>
