title: Sounds and music
---

The **_ink_ + Pixi’VN integration** introduces a "# script" that allows you to use the <DynamicLink href="/start/sound">sounds and music</DynamicLink>. To do this, you need to use the following syntax:

`#` + `[operation]` + `sound` + `[alias]` + `[parameters]`

Where:

- `#`: It is a special character used by **_ink_ syntax** for use a special script.
- `[operation]`: It is the operation that you want to execute with the sound element. The available operations are:
  - `play`: Play a sound. (Read more [here](#play-a-sound-in-ink))
  - `pause`: Pause a sound. (Read more [here](#pause-a-sound-in-ink))
  - `resume`: Resume a sound. (Read more [here](#resume-a-sound-in-ink))
  - `stop`: Stop a sound. (Read more [here](#stop-a-sound-in-ink))
  - `volume`: Change the volume of a sound. (Read more [here](#change-the-volume-of-a-sound-in-ink))
- `[alias]` It is the alias of the sound. The alias is a string that identifies the sound.
  - If the alias includes spaces, you must use double quotes.
- `[parameters]` It is the parameters of the operation. The parameters depend on the operation.
  - If the parameters include spaces, you must use double quotes.
  - If the parameters is a object, you must use the JSON format and the first character must be `\{` and the last character must be `\}`. Example: `\{ "volume": 100, name: "Music" \}`

## Play a sound in _ink_

You can use the `play` to play a sound in **_ink_**. To do this, you need to use the following syntax:

`#` + `play` + `sound` + `[alias]` + `[parameters]`

- `[parameters] (Optional)`: In the `parameters` you must include the properties of `SoundPlayOptions` that you want to set. The `parameters` must be set as follows: `parameterName` + `SPACE` + `value`. If the `value` is a string and includes spaces, you must use double quotes.

```ink tab="ink/start.ink"
# play sound bird
Now the bird is singing.
# play sound bird volume 100
Now the bird is singing louder.
```

```ts tab="utils/defineAssets.ts"
import { sound } from "@drincs/pixi-vn";

export async function defineAssets() {
    sound.add('bird', 'https://pixijs.io/sound/examples/resources/bird.mp3');
}
```

## Pause a sound in _ink_

To pause a sound in **_ink_**, you can use the `pause` operation. To do this, you need to use the following syntax:

`#` + `pause` + `sound` + `[alias]`

```ink title="ink"
# pause sound bird
```

## Resume a sound in _ink_

To resume a sound in **_ink_**, you can use the `resume` operation. To do this, you need to use the following syntax:

`#` + `resume` + `sound` + `[alias]`

# resume sound bird
```

## Stop a sound in _ink_

To remove a sound in **_ink_**, you can use the `stop` operation. To do this, you need to use the following syntax:

`#` + `stop` + `sound` + `[alias]`

```ink title="ink"
# stop sound bird
```

## Change the volume of a sound in _ink_

To change the volume of a sound in **_ink_**, you can use the `volume` operation. To do this, you need to use the following syntax:

`#` + `volume` + `sound` + `[alias]` + `[number]`

- `[number]`: It is a number from 0 to 100 that corresponds to the volume you want to set.

```ink title="ink"
# volume sound bird 100
```
