title: Assets
---

As explained in more detail <DynamicLink href="/start/assets-management">here</DynamicLink>, it is recommended to initialize the asset matrix at project start and load the assets and think about when the assets should be loaded.

On ink you have less control than in Javascript/Typescript over how and when to load assets. On **_ink_**, pixi-vn provides a single function that <DynamicLink href="/start/assets-management#load-assets-before-a-label-starts">load assets before a label starts</DynamicLink>. To do this, you need to use the following syntax:

`#` + `[operation]` + `[assets or bundle]` + `[list of URL/path of the image]`

- `#`: It is a special character used by **_ink_ syntax** for use a special script.
- `[operation]`: It is the operation that you want to do. The available operations are:
  - `load`: It loads with await the assets or bundle (`Assets.load` or `Assets.loadBundle`).
  - `lazyload`: It loads the assets or bundle in the background (`Assets.backgroundLoad` or `Assets.backgroundLoadBundle`).
- `[assets or bundle]`: It is the type of asset that you want to load. The available types are:
  - `assets`: It loads the assets.
  - `bundle`: It loads the bundle.
- `[list of URL/path of the image]`: It is the list of URL/path of the images that you want to show. If you have initialized the <DynamicLink href="/start/assets-management#initialize-the-asset-matrix-at-project-start">asset matrix</DynamicLink>, you can use the alias of the texture. Keep in mind that to write `https://` in **_ink_** you must use `https:\/\/` because the `//` is considered a comment in **_ink_**.

```ink tab="ink/start.ink"
=== start ===
# lazyload bundle main_menu start
# load assets eggHead flowerTop my_video
# show image eggHead
# show image flowerTop
# show video my_video
# pause
-> start
```

```ts tab="utils/defineAssets.ts"
import { Assets } from "@drincs/pixi-vn"

export async function defineAssets() {
    // manifest
    await Assets.init({ manifest });
    // single asset
    Assets.add({ alias: 'eggHead', src: "https://pixijs.com/assets/eggHead.png" })
    Assets.add({ alias: 'flowerTop', src: "https://pixijs.com/assets/flowerTop.png" })
    Assets.add({ alias: "my_video", src: "https://pixijs.com/assets/video.mp4" });
}
```
