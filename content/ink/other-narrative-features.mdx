  Explains Pixiâ€™VN usage of native ink features such as `pause` and `continue` and how they affect `steps` and dialogue flow.

import { PauseExample, ContinueExample } from "@/components/ink-examples";

## Pause

After executing a `#` script, the system performs a <DynamicLink href="/start/labels-flow#continue">`continue`</DynamicLink> to move to the next `step`. For example, in this case you will see the image and the dialogue text.

```ink
=== start ===
# show image alien eggHead
Hello, world!
-> DONE
```

You can use `# pause` to stop progression to the next `step` and clear the dialogue text until the flow resumes. This is useful when you need to display an image or change state without showing any dialogue.

The syntax is:

```ink
# pause
```

```ink tab="ink/start.ink"
=== start ===
# show image alien eggHead
# pause
Hello, world!
-> DONE
```

```ts tab="assets/manifest.ts"
import { AssetsManifest } from "@drincs/pixi-vn";

/**
 * Manifest for the assets used in the game.
 * You can read more about the manifest here: https://pixijs.com/8.x/guides/components/assets#loading-multiple-assets
 */
const manifest: AssetsManifest = {
    bundles: [
        {
            name: "start",
            assets: [
                {
                    alias: "eggHead",
                    src: "https://pixijs.com/assets/eggHead.png",
                },
            ],
        },
    ],
};
export default manifest;
```

<PauseExample />

## Continue

Normally, when a choice is presented after dialogue the narration uses two `steps`: the first shows only the dialogue, and the second shows the dialogue plus the choices.

```ink
=== start ===
Who are we going to rescue: the kitten or the wizard?
* [workplace_midground_kitten] 
    -> END
* [workplace_midground_wizard]
    -> END
```

To present the dialogue and the choices in a single `step`, append `<># continue` to the dialogue line. This keeps the UI compact and avoids an extra `step`.

```ink
=== start ===
Who are we going to rescue: the kitten or the wizard?<># continue
* [workplace_midground_kitten] 
    -> END
* [workplace_midground_wizard]
    -> END
```
