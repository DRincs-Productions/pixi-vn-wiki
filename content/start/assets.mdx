description: Overview of asset types and storage options (local or online) in Pixi’VN, with usage examples.

**What are assets?** Assets are all files that are not code, such as images, sounds, and videos.

You can use assets saved locally in the project or online (for the second option, you need to make sure that the cloud service you are using allows *CORS requests*). If your assets are online, your game will require an internet connection. You should notify the user and block the game if there is no connection.

If you are creating a visual novel, it is recommended to keep frequently used assets locally. For assets used only once in the game, it is better to publish them online.

To load and manipulate assets (images, gifs, videos, etc.) you will need to use `Assets`. `Assets` is a class with many features and comes from the PixiJS library. For more information, read [here](https://pixijs.com/8.x/guides/components/assets). It is also very important that you read this documentation to better <DynamicLink href="/start/assets-management">organize the uploading of your assets</DynamicLink>.

You mainly have two choices for where to save your assets: locally or online.

## Local assets

To save and use assets locally, you can use any folder—there are no restrictions. However, it is recommended to use the `assets` folder. Inside this folder, you can create subfolders to better organize your assets.

Here is an example of how to import and load an asset into your project:

```ts title="utils/assets.ts"
import { Assets } from "@drincs/pixi-vn";
import bg01hallway from "../assets/images/bg01-hallway.webp";

Assets.add({
    alias: "bg01-hallway",
    src: bg01hallway,
});
```

<Accordions>

<Accordion title="pixijs_assetpack" id="pixijs-assetpack">

AssetPack is a tool for optimizing local assets for the web. It can be used to transform, combine, and compress assets.

If you want to use AssetPack, you can find the documentation [here](https://pixijs.io/assetpack).

## Assets hosting

You can save your assets online. This is a good option if you want to save space on your computer. You can use any cloud service that allows you to upload files and generate a public URL (CORS enabled).

Here is an example of how to import and load an asset into your project:

```ts title="utils/assets.ts"
import { Assets } from "@drincs/pixi-vn";

Assets.add({
    alias: "bg01-hallway",
    src: "https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pixi-vn.appspot.com/o/public%2Fbreakdown%2Fbg01-hallway.webp?alt=media",
});
```

You can save your assets as you like, with complete freedom. If you plan to save your assets online, here are some of the options:

<Accordions>

<Accordion title="github" id="github">

You can use Github to host your assets. You can use the raw link of the file in your project. The link will be in the following format:

```text
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/[repository]/raw/refs/heads/main/[file path]
```

* **Price**: Completely free.
* **Space limits**: No space limits, but each single file must not exceed 100 MB.
* **Type of files**: You can upload any type of file.
* **Traffic**: Speed is not the best.
* **Edit assets**: You can edit the file while keeping the same URL.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="image_hosting" id="image-hosting">

Image hosting is a service that allows you to upload images. There are many sites to upload images for free, for example [imgbb](https://imgbb.com/), [imgix](https://www.imgix.com/), [imgur](https://imgur.com/). You can use the link of the image in your project.

* **Price**: Completely free, but you can pay for more features.

<Accordion title="Cloud_storage" id="Cloud-storage">

Cloud storage is a service that allows you to upload files online.
