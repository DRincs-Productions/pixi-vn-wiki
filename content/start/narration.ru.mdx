title: Narration
---

The narration is the core of the visual novel. The narrative is the set of <DynamicLink href="/start/dialogue.md">dialogues</DynamicLink>, <DynamicLink href="/start/choices.md">choices</DynamicLink> and <DynamicLink href="/start/input">input prompt</DynamicLink> shown to the player as the game progresses.

With Pixi’VN, you have the option to use various types of narrative languages. You can also switch from one language to another to take advantage of the features of each one.

- **JavaScript/TypeScript** is a programming language. You can use it to write your narrative, but it will lead you to write a lot of code. It has the advantage that it can access all functions of the project.
- **<DynamicLink href="/ink/ink">_ink_</DynamicLink>** is a narrative language that allows you to write a narrative easily, without having to write a lot of code.
- **<DynamicLink href="/renpy/renpy">Ren'Py</DynamicLink>** is a narrative language that allows you to write a narrative easily, without having to write a lot of code.
