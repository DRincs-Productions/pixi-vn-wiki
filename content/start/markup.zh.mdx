title: Markup language
---

The markup language is a text-encoding system which specifies the structure and formatting of a document and potentially the relationships among its parts. Markup can control the display of a document or enrich its content to facilitate automated processing. There are various types of markup languages, such as HTML, KML/KMZ, XML, Markdown, and others.

Due to its simplicity and popularity it is recommended to use <DynamicLink href="/start/markup-markdown">**Markdown**</DynamicLink>. Furthermore, since it is often possible to combine Markdown with HTML, it is possible to use the CSS to style the text. It is recommended to use a CSS framework like <DynamicLink href="/start/markup-tailwindcss">**Tailwind CSS**</DynamicLink>.
