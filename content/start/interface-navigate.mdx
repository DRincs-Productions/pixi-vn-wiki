title: Navigate/switch between UI screens
---

To switch between UI screens (without interrupting the canvas), you can use popups and modals, or navigate between different [paths/routes](#what-is-the-url-path-and-routes).

## What is the URL Path and Routes?

The URL Path is the part of the URL that comes after the domain. For example, in the URL `https://example.com/path/to/page`, the path is `/path/to/page`.

A routering system can be used to manage navigation between URL Paths. For example you can use:

* [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
* [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/)
* [Angular Router](https://angular.io/guide/router)
* [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest)
