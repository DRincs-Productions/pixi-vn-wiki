title: Animations and transitions
description: Overview of how to animate and transition Pixi’VN canvas components using the animate function, which leverages the motion library and Pixi’VN Tickers for smooth and customizable effects between steps and labels.

Animating components in Pixi’VN is straightforward. The core animation function is <DynamicLink href="/start/canvas-motion">`animate`</DynamicLink>, which wraps the popular [`motion`](https://motion.dev/) library. While `motion` handles the mathematical calculations for the animation, the actual updates are triggered by <DynamicLink href="/start/canvas-tickers">Tickers</DynamicLink> in Pixi’VN.

You also have several functions to perform <DynamicLink href="/start/canvas-transition">transitions</DynamicLink> between steps. All transitions are built on top of the `animate` function, so you can easily create custom transitions as well.
