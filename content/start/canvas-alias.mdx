title: Canvas component aliases
---

Each component added into the canvas must be assigned an alias. An alias is a way to refer to a component by a unique string.

If a component is added by assigning an existing alias, the new component will replace the old one.

The alias corresponds to `PixiJSComponent.label`, so do not change the `label`, but use the [methods provided by Pixi'VN](/start/canvas-functions) to change the alias.

## Heredity factor

If a component is added using an existing alias the new component, in addition to replacing the old one, will inherit the properties, the zIndex and the [tickers](/start/canvas-tickers) of the old component.

<Sandbox
  template="6yql5k"
  entry="/src/ink/start.ink,/src/utils/assets-utility.ts"
/>

## Edit canvas component alias

To edit the alias of a canvas component, you can use the `canvas.editAlias`. If the alias has a or more [tickers](/start/canvas-tickers) associated, it will be automatically edited in the ticker.

The `editAlias` method have the following parameters:

* `oldAlias`: The old alias of the component to edit.
* `newAlias`: The new alias of the component.

```typescript
import { canvas } from '@drincs/pixi-vn'

canvas.editAlias('sprite1', 'sprite2')
```

## Game layer alias

In PixiJS the game layer is the layer that contains all the canvas components of the game.

This component has been assigned a special alias, `CANVAS_APP_GAME_LAYER_ALIAS`, which is used to reference the game layer in the script.

This is very useful if you want to run some [animations or effects](/start/canvas-animations-effects) at the entire window. Some features are not allowed on this item, such as deletion.

```typescript
import { CANVAS_APP_GAME_LAYER_ALIAS, shakeEffect } from '@drincs/pixi-vn'

shakeEffect(CANVAS_APP_GAME_LAYER_ALIAS)
```
