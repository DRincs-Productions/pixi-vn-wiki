**What is Spine 2D?** Spine 2D is a powerful 2D animation software specifically designed for game development. It utilizes a skeletal animation system, meaning that characters and objects are animated using a hierarchy of "bones" that control the movement of attached parts.

You can learn more about Spine 2D on the [Spine 2D website](https://it.esotericsoftware.com/).

Having the ability to use elements with advanced animations can be very useful in many cases.

The [spine-pixi](https://it.esotericsoftware.com/spine-pixi) library provides this capability to PixiJS.
