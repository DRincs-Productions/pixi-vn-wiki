---

Your Pixi’VN game can be distributed as a website, allowing players to access it directly in their web browsers. This is a great way to reach a wider audience, as no downloads or installations are required.  
To do this, you need to [host the game on a server](#hosting-and-deploying).

## Hosting and deploying

You can use various hosting services like [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). These platforms offer free plans and have similar setup processes.

This guide uses Firebase as an example for hosting.  
Firebase offers additional features such as database hosting and authentication, and is a reliable Google product.

1. [Create a Firebase project](https://console.firebase.google.com/) if you haven't already.
2. Install the Firebase CLI:

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

1. Log in to your Google account (if first time):

```bash
firebase login
```

1. Initialize Firebase in your project directory:

```bash
firebase init
```

Follow the CLI prompts:

- **Features**: Choose `Hosting: Configure files for Firebase Hosting and (optionally) set up GitHub Action deploys`.
- **Default project**: Select your Firebase project.
- **Detected Vite codebase**: Enter `no`.
- **Use a web framework?**: Enter `no`.
- **Public directory**: Enter `dist`.
- **Single-page app?**: Enter `yes` (ensures routing and deep linking work).
- **Overwrite dist/index.html?**: Enter `no`.
- **Set up GitHub deploys?**: Enter `no` (Optional).

A `firebase.json` config file will be generated.

Example `firebase.json`:

```json title="firebase.json"
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "dist",
    "ignore": ["firebase.json", "**/.*", "**/node_modules/**"],
    "rewrites": [
      {
        "source": "**",
        "destination": "/index.html"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

See the [Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/full-config#section-firebase-json) for more details.

To deploy your app:

```bash
npm run build
firebase deploy
```

## Enable "Add to Home Screen" (PWA Plugin)

Enabling installation as a "browser application" allows users to use your game as a standalone app on their device.

If you use [Vite js](https://vitejs.dev/) as your build tool, you can add the [PWA Vite Plugin](https://vite-pwa-org.netlify.app/). See this [example](https://vite-pwa-org.netlify.app/guide/pwa-minimal-requirements.html#web-app-manifest).

Otherwise, create a `manifest.json` file according to your framework's requirements.
