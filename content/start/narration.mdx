description: Overview of narrative languages in Pixi’VN and how to structure interactive stories using dialogues, choices, and input prompts.
---

Narration is the core of a visual novel. It consists of <DynamicLink href="/start/dialogue">dialogues</DynamicLink>, <DynamicLink href="/start/choices">choices</DynamicLink>, and <DynamicLink href="/start/input">input prompts</DynamicLink> shown to the player as the game progresses.

With Pixi’VN, you can use different narrative languages and even switch between them to take advantage of each one's features.

* **JavaScript/TypeScript**: A programming language that lets you write your narrative with full access to all project functions, but may require more code.
* **<DynamicLink href="/ink">*ink*</DynamicLink>**: A narrative language designed for writing stories easily, with minimal code.
* **<DynamicLink href="/renpy">Ren'Py</DynamicLink>**: Another narrative language for writing stories with little code.
