  Guide for IDE authors and editors: How to export a JSON file to integrate tools with Pixi'VN.
---

Pixi’VN is a free, open-source npm library and will never be tied to a single IDE or graphics tool.

We encourage game IDE or tool developers to add an export that produces a file compatible with Pixi'VN projects.

## Create

If you are starting from scratch, here is some practical advice:

- Be realistic about the time and skills required. Many projects are started and never finished.
- Choose your languages and tools based on your team and goals. We recommend using TypeScript so you can reuse Pixi’VN typings.
- The simplest and most portable approach is to export a JSON that follows the <DynamicLink href="/json">PixiVNJson</DynamicLink> model. That JSON contains the sequence of instructions Pixi’VN will execute and can be injected into a Pixi’VN template by the user or your tool.
- Exporting JSON keeps your tool engine-agnostic and makes it easier to support other engines later.

## Migrate

Already have a tool and want Pixi’VN compatibility? Usually this is straightforward:

- If your tool already exports or internally serializes instructions as objects or JSON, create a small mapping layer that converts your format to the <DynamicLink href="/json">PixiVNJson</DynamicLink> model.
- If your tool uses a different internal model, evaluate whether it’s worth adding a converter. If the effort is high and the feature set doesn't align, consider keeping it separate.

Once you can produce PixiVNJson, users can drop the exported JSON into a Pixi’VN template to run the game.
