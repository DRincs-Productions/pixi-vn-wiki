title: Make your IDE or graphical editor
---

Pixi’VN's goal is to remain a free, open-source npm library and will never be tied to a single IDE or graphics tool.

The goal is to encourage developers of video game IDEs or graphics tools to integrate the ability to export a game that uses Pixi’VN.

## Crea

Are you starting from scratch? I have some advice before you begin:

* First, you need to understand whether you really have the time and skills to develop the project you have in mind and whether your idea is truly useful. All programmers with some experience have started a project and abandoned it before it was completed.
* Based on your knowledge, you should decide which languages ​​and tools to use. However, it's recommended to use Typescript so you can use the types from Pixi’VN.

The best way to do this is to create your own tool using pixi-vn-json. In short, this consists of generating a json that respects the pixi-vn-json model. This json will contain the list of instructions that Pixi’VN will run. Finally, this json will be inserted into a Pixi’VN template, either by the user or by the tool.

Using json allows you to keep your tool independent and thus give you the ability to support other engines.

## Migrate

Already have a tool and want to make it compatible with Pixi’VN? Great, if your engine exports or internally generates objects and json files with the instructions the engine will execute, then it'll be very easy to make it compatible with Pixi’VN. Otherwise I advise you to leave it alone.

the only thing you will need to do is remap your json object to one that respects the pixi-vn-json model.

This way you can generate a json file that will be introduced, by the user and the tool, into a Pixi’VN template.
