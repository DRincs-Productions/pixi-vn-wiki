title: Make your first Visual Novel
description: Step-by-step guide to creating a visual novel with Pixi’VN, covering project setup, narrative, assets, and interactivity.

import { TSVisualNovelExample } from "@/components/vn-examples";
import { InkVisualNovelExample } from "@/components/vn-ink-examples";

This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating your first Visual Novel.

**What is a Visual Novel?** A visual novel (VN) is a form of digital interactive fiction. Visual novels are often associated with the medium of video games, but are not always labeled as such themselves. They combine a textual narrative with static or animated illustrations and a varying degree of interactivity. The format is more rarely referred to as novel game, a retranscription of the wasei-eigo term noberu gēmu (ノベルゲーム), which is more often used in Japanese.

For testing purposes, in this guide we will be recreating the visual novel [Breakdown](https://joshpowlison.itch.io/breakdown) using Pixi’VN. Breakdown is a short story that has all the features that a visual novel should have. Josh Powlison, the creator of Breakdown, has given us permission to use his narration for educational purposes❤️.

Since Pixi’VN gives you the ability to write your own narration by choosing one or more <DynamicLink href="/start/narration">available narrative languages</DynamicLink>, examples will be made for each currently available language at each development step.

## Create a new project

The first step is to create a new project. You can find more information on how to create a new project starting from a template <DynamicLink href="/start#project-initialization">here</DynamicLink>. We will use the template "Visual Novel - React".

`Visual Novel -> React`

After the creation is complete, it is very important to read the `README.md` file that is in the root of the project. This file contains important information about the project and how to use it.

In our case, to start the project we will simply need to execute the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Characters creation

Now we will define the characters of this story. To do this, we will define in the `/values/characters.ts` file the characters that we will be using. For more information on how to create and use characters you can consult: <DynamicLink href="/start/character">Characters</DynamicLink>

What does `mc` mean? `mc` is a common abbreviation for "Main Character". It is a common practice in visual novels to use `mc` as the main character's name.

```ts tab="values/characters.ts"
import { RegisteredCharacters } from "@drincs/pixi-vn";
import Character from "../models/Character";

export const mc = new Character('mc', {
    name: 'Me',
});

export const james = new Character('james', {
    name: 'James',
    color: "#0084ac"
});

export const steph = new Character('steph', {
    name: 'Steph',
    color: "#ac5900"
});

export const sly = new Character('sly', {
    name: 'Sly',
    color: "#6d00ac"
});

RegisteredCharacters.add([mc, james, steph, sly]);
```

```ts tab="App.tsx"
// Remember to import the character file at least once into your project. // [!code focus]
import "./values/characters"; // [!code focus]

export default function App() {
return // ...
}
```

## First draft of the narrative

<Callout title="Markup" type="info">

All templates have  <DynamicLink href="/start/markup-markdown">Markdown</DynamicLink> and <DynamicLink href="/start/markup-tailwindcss">Tailwind CSS</DynamicLink> support, so we will use it for our narration.

</Callout>

Now we can start writing the "first draft" of the <DynamicLink href="/start/narration">narration</DynamicLink> of the visual novel.
We will create the first <DynamicLink href="/start/labels">`label`</DynamicLink> called `start`, which will be the beginning of the game. After that we can write the <DynamicLink href="/start/dialogue">dialogues</DynamicLink> that will follow in our visual novel.

This is the example:

```ink tab="ink" title="ink/start.ink" groupId="narrative_language"
=== start ===
james: You're my roommate's replacement, huh?
james: Don't worry, you don't have much to live up to. Just don't use heroin like the last guy, and you' fine!
mc: ...

He thrusts out his hand.

james: James!
mc: ...Peter.

I take his hand and shake.

james: Ooh, Peter! Nice, firm handshake! The last quy always gave me the dead fish. I already think we'r gonna get along fine.
james: Come on in and... 
james: ...
james: I know you're both watching, come on out already!

sly: I just wanted to see what the new guy was like. Hey, you, Peter- be nice to our little brother, or you'll have to deal with *us*.
mc: ...
james: Peter, this is Sly. Yes, that is her real name.

I put out my hand.

sly: I'm not shakin' your hand until I decide you're an all-right dude. Sorry, policy.
mc: Fair enough, I'm a pretty scary guy, or so l've been told.
james: The redhead behind her is Stephanie.
// Example of using Tailwind CSS
steph: <span class="inline-block motion-translate-y-loop-25">Hey</span>! Everyone calls me Steph. I'll shake your hand.

// ...
-> DONE
```

```ts tab="Typescript" title="labels/startLabel.ts" groupId="narrative_language"
const startLabel = newLabel("start", [
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `You're my roommate's replacement, huh?` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `Don't worry, you don't have much to live up to. Just don't use heroin like the last guy, and you' fine!` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: mc, text: `...` },
    () => { narration.dialogue = "He thrusts out his hand." },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `James!` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: mc, text: `...Peter.` },
    () => { narration.dialogue = "I take his hand and shake." },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `Ooh, Peter! Nice, firm handshake! The last quy always gave me the dead fish. I already think we'r gonna get along fine.` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `Come on in and...` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `...` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `I know you're both watching, come on out already!` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `I just wanted to see what the new guy was like. Hey, you, Peter- be nice to our little brother, or you'll have to deal with *us*.` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: mc, text: `...` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `Peter, this is Sly. Yes, that is her real name.` },
    () => { narration.dialogue = "I put out my hand." },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `I'm not shakin' your hand until I decide you're an all-right dude. Sorry, policy.` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: mc, text: `Fair enough, I'm a pretty scary guy, or so l've been told.` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `The redhead behind her is Stephanie.` },
    // Example of using Tailwind CSS
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: steph, text: `<span class="inline-block motion-translate-y-loop-25">Hey</span>! Everyone calls me Steph. I'll shake your hand.` },
    // ...
]);
export default startLabel;
```

### Split the narrative into `labels`

It is not advisable to create very long `labels` (even for linear visual novels), but it is advisable to create multiple small `labels` and "call" them when needed with the <DynamicLink href="/start/labels-flow">narration flow control features</DynamicLink>.

For this reason, even if in our case our story is linear, it will be divided into two `labels`, the first will be the one we just created (`start`), while the second will be called `second_part`.

This is the example:

```ink tab="ink" title="ink/start.ink" groupId="narrative_language"
=== start ===
james: You're my roommate's replacement, huh?
james: Don't worry, you don't have much to live up to. Just don't use heroin like the last guy, and you' fine!
mc: ...

He thrusts out his hand.

james: James!
mc: ...Peter.

// ...
-> second_part

=== second_part ===

She enters my room before I'VE even had a chance to. \\n\\n...I could've just come back and gotten the platter later...
She sets it on a desk. I throw my two paper bags down beside the empty bed.

steph: They got you a new mattress, right? That last guy was a druggie, did James tell you that?
sly: *We're* the reason he got expelled!
steph: Sly! If word gets out about that... well, actually, it wouldn't matter, *he's* the one who shot himself up.

I'm fumbling for a new subject.

// ...
-> DONE
```

```ts tab="Typescript" title="labels/startLabel.ts" groupId="narrative_language"
const startLabel = newLabel("start", [
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `You're my roommate's replacement, huh?` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `Don't worry, you don't have much to live up to. Just don't use heroin like the last guy, and you' fine!` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: mc, text: `...` },
    () => { narration.dialogue = "He thrusts out his hand." },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `James!` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: mc, text: `...Peter.` },
    // ...
    async (props) => await narration.jump(secondPart, props),
]);
export default startLabel;

const secondPart = newLabel("second_part", [
    () => { narration.dialogue = `She enters my room before I'VE even had a chance to. \n\n...I could've just come back and gotten the platter later...` },
    () => { narration.dialogue = `She sets it on a desk. I throw my two paper bags down beside the empty bed.` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: steph, text: `They got you a new mattress, right? That last guy was a druggie, did James tell you that?` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: sly, text: `*We're* the reason he got expelled!` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: steph, text: `Sly! If word gets out about that... well, actually, it wouldn't matter, *he's* the one who shot himself up.` },
    () => { narration.dialogue = `I'm fumbling for a new subject.` },
    // ...
]);
```

## Choice menus

Now we will ask the player if he wants to continue with the second part of the visual novel.

To do this, we will use the <DynamicLink href="/start/choices">choice menu</DynamicLink>.

This is the example:

```ink tab="ink" title="ink/start.ink" groupId="narrative_language"
=== start ===
// ...

You want continue to the next part?
* Yes, I want to continue
-> second_part
* No, I want to stop here
-> END

=== second_part ===

// ...
-> DONE
```

```ts tab="Typescript" title="labels/startLabel.ts" groupId="narrative_language"
const startLabel = newLabel("start", [
    // ...
    async () => {
        narration.dialogue = `You want continue to the next part?`
        narration.choices = [
            newChoiceOption("Yes, I want to continue", secondPart, {}, { type: "jump" }),
            newCloseChoiceOption("No, I want to stop here"),
        ]
    },
]);
export default startLabel;

const secondPart = newLabel("second_part", [
    // ...
]);
```

## Edit character information and use it as a variable

Now I will give the player the ability to change the name of the `mc`.

To do this, I will ask the player to <DynamicLink href="/start/input">complete an input box using Pixi’VN's features</DynamicLink>.

After getting the input value, you can <DynamicLink href="/start/character#edit">set the character name</DynamicLink> using the obtained value.

This is the example:

```ink tab="ink" title="ink/start.ink" groupId="narrative_language"
=== start ===
// ...

He thrusts out his hand.
# request input type string default Peter
What is your name?
# rename mc { _input_value_ }

// ...
-> DONE
```

```ts tab="Typescript" title="labels/startLabel.ts" groupId="narrative_language"
const startLabel = newLabel("start", [
    // ...
    () => { narration.dialogue = `He thrusts out his hand.` },
    () => {
        narration.requestInput({ type: "string" }, "Peter")
        narration.dialogue = `What is your name?`
    },
    () => {
        mc.name = narration.inputValue as string
    },
    // ...
]);
export default startLabel;
```

Now we could <DynamicLink href="/start/character#use">use character names</DynamicLink> within dialogues.

This is the example:

```ink tab="ink" title="ink/start.ink" groupId="narrative_language"
VAR steph_fullname = "Stephanie"

=== start ===
// ...

sly: I just wanted to see what the new guy was like. Hey, you, [mc]- be nice to our little brother, or you'll have to deal with *us*.
mc: ...
james: [mc], this is [sly]. Yes, that is her real name.

I put out my hand.

sly: I'm not shakin' your hand until I decide you're an all-right dude. Sorry, policy.
mc: Fair enough, I'm a pretty scary guy, or so l've been told.
james: The redhead behind her is [steph_fullname].
steph: Hey! Everyone calls me [steph]. I'll shake your hand.

She puts out her hand, and I take it.

mc: Thanks, good to meet you, [steph_fullname].
steph: WOW, that is, like, the most perfect handshake I've ever had! Firm, but also gentle. [sly], you *gotta* shake his hand!

// ...
-> DONE
```

```ts tab="Typescript" title="labels/startLabel.ts" groupId="narrative_language"
const steph_fullname = "Stephanie";

const startLabel = newLabel("start", [
    // ...
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: sly, text: `I just wanted to see what the new guy was like. Hey, you, ${mc.name}- be nice to our little brother, or you'll have to deal with *us*.` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: mc, text: `...` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `${mc.name}, this is ${sly.name}. Yes, that is her real name.` },
    () => { narration.dialogue = `I put out my hand.` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: sly, text: `I'm not shakin' your hand until I decide you're an all-right dude. Sorry, policy.` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: mc, text: `Fair enough, I'm a pretty scary guy, or so I've been told.` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `The redhead behind her is ${steph_fullname}.` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: steph, text: `Hey! Everyone calls me ${steph.name}. I'll shake your hand.` },
    () => { narration.dialogue = `She puts out her hand, and I take it.` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: mc, text: `Thanks, good to meet you, ${steph_fullname}.` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: steph, text: `WOW, that is, like, the most perfect handshake I've ever had! Firm, but also gentle. ${sly.name}, you *gotta* shake his hand!` },
    // ...
]);
export default startLabel;
```

## Use the "glue" feature of dialogues

In visual novels, it is often useful to paste text into the current dialogue. For example, to pause a conversation and have it continue in a subsequent `step`. To do this, we can use the <DynamicLink href="/start/dialogue#dialogue-glue">glue functionality</DynamicLink>.

This is the example:

```ink tab="ink" title="ink/start.ink" groupId="narrative_language"
=== start ===
// ...

james: Ooh, [mc]! Nice, firm handshake!
<>The last guy always gave me the dead fish.
<>I already think we're gonna get along fine.
james: Come on in and...

// ...
-> DONE
```

```ts tab="Typescript" title="labels/startLabel.ts" groupId="narrative_language"
const startLabel = newLabel("start", [
    // ...
    async () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `Ooh, ${mc.name}! Nice, firm handshake!` },
    async () => {
        narration.dialogGlue = true
        narration.dialogue = `The last guy always gave me the dead fish.`
    },
    async () => {
        narration.dialogGlue = true
        narration.dialogue = `I already think we're gonna get along fine.`
    },
    async () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `Come on in and...` },
    // ...
]);
export default startLabel;
```

## Define assets and load them

<Callout type="info">

To load and manipulate assets (images, gifs, videos...) you will need to use `Assets`. `Assets` is a class with many features and comes from the PixiJS library, if you want more information read [here](https://pixijs.com/8.x/guides/components/assets).

</Callout>

One of the first steps is choosing where to save your visual novel assets. In this case, we will save the assets in the Firebase storage (a hosting service). You can use any hosting service you prefer or even save the assets locally in the project, read more about it <DynamicLink href="/start/assets">here</DynamicLink>.

Before using an asset it is highly recommended to <DynamicLink href="/start/assets-management#initialize-the-asset-matrix-at-project-start">initialize the asset matrix</DynamicLink>.

By default, as you can see in the `assets/manifest.ts` file, all templates in the `onLoadingLabel` try to load in the background the "bundle assets" with the alias equal to the current `label` id. So it is recommended to add, in the `manifest`, a "bundle assets" for each `label` with the alias equal to the `label` id and containing the images used in that `label`.

This is the example:

```ts tab="assets/manifest.ts"
import { AssetsManifest } from "@drincs/pixi-vn";
import { MAIN_MENU_ROUTE } from "../constans";

/**
 * Manifest for the assets used in the game.
 * You can read more about the manifest here: https://pixijs.com/8.x/guides/components/assets#loading-multiple-assets
 */
const manifest: AssetsManifest = {
    bundles: [
        // screens
        {
            name: MAIN_MENU_ROUTE,
            assets: [
                {
                    alias: "background_main_menu",
                    src: "https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pixi-vn.appspot.com/o/public%2Fmain-menu.webp?alt=media",
                },
            ],
        },
        // labels
        {
            name: "start",
            assets: [
                {
                    alias: "bg01-hallway",
                    src: "https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pixi-vn.appspot.com/o/public%2Fbreakdown%2Fbg01-hallway.webp?alt=media",
                },
            ],
        },
        {
            name: "second_part",
            assets: [
                {
                    alias: "bg02-dorm",
                    src: "https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pixi-vn.appspot.com/o/public%2Fbreakdown%2Fbg02-dorm.webp?alt=media",
                },
            ],
        },
        // characters
        {
            name: "fm01",
            assets: [
                {
                    alias: "fm01-body",
                    src: "https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pixi-vn.appspot.com/o/public%2Fbreakdown%2Ffm01%2Ffm01-body.webp?alt=media",
                },

 */
export async function defineAssets() {
    Assets.init({ manifest });

    // The game will not start until these asserts are loaded.
    await Assets.loadBundle("main_menu");

    // The game will start immediately, but these asserts will be loaded in the background.
    // Assets.backgroundLoadBundle("main_menu");
    // Assets.backgroundLoad("background_main_menu");
}
```

```ts tab="src/main.ts"
import { Assets, canvas, Container, Game } from "@drincs/pixi-vn";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";
import { CANVAS_UI_LAYER_NAME } from "./constans";
import "./index.css";
import "./values/characters";

// ...

Game.onLoadingLabel((_stepId, { id }) => { // [!code focus]
    Assets.backgroundLoadBundle(id); // [!code focus]
}); // [!code focus]
```

## Add background and character images

Now it's time to think about the visual part too. We will add the background and character sprites to the visual novel canvas.

**What is a sprite?** In computer graphics, a sprite is a two-dimensional bitmap that is integrated into a larger scene, most often in a 2D video game.

In our case the character sprites are composed of 3 images: the body, the eyes and the mouth. Then we use <DynamicLink href="/start/canvas-image-container">ImageContainer</DynamicLink> to compose the character. You can find more information on how to add canvas components in <DynamicLink href="/start/canvas-components">this documentation</DynamicLink>.

This is the example:

```ink tab="ink" title="ink/start.ink" groupId="narrative_language"
=== start ===
# show image bg bg01-hallway
# show imagecontainer james [m01-body m01-eyes-smile m01-mouth-neutral01] xAlign 0.5 yAlign 1
james: You're my roommate's replacement, huh?
# show imagecontainer james [m01-body m01-eyes-grin m01-mouth-smile01]
james: Don't worry, you don't have much to live up to. Just don't use heroin like the last guy, and you'll be fine!
# show imagecontainer james [m01-body m01-eyes-smile m01-mouth-grin00]
mc: ...

// ...
-> DONE
```

```ts tab="Typescript" title="labels/startLabel.ts" groupId="narrative_language"
const startLabel = newLabel("start", [
    async () => {
        await showImage("bg", "bg01-hallway");
        await showImageContainer("james", ["m01-body", "m01-eyes-smile", "m01-mouth-neutral01"], { xAlign: 0.5, yAlign: 1 });
        narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `You're my roommate's replacement, huh?` }
    },
    async () => {
        await showImageContainer("james", ["m01-body", "m01-eyes-grin", "m01-mouth-smile01"])
        narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `Don't worry, you don't have much to live up to. Just don't use heroin like the last guy, and you'll be fine!` }
    },
    async () => {
        await showImageContainer("james", ["m01-body", "m01-eyes-smile", "m01-mouth-grin00"])
        narration.dialogue = { character: mc, text: `...` }
    },
    // ...
]);
export default startLabel;
```

## Smart asset loading

In our case we saved the game images on a hosting service (Firebase). For this reason the asset loading is not timely.

In order for the player not to perceive too many loadings we should group them in certain phases of the game. In my case I will load the most used images at the start of the `label`.

You can find more information on how to manage the loadings <DynamicLink href="/start/assets-management">here</DynamicLink>.

This is the example:

```ink tab="ink" title="ink/start.ink" groupId="narrative_language"
=== start ===
# lazyload bundle m01 fm01 fm02 // [!code focus]

# show image bg bg01-hallway
# show imagecontainer james [m01-body m01-eyes-smile m01-mouth-neutral01] xAlign 0.5 yAlign 1 with movein direction right speed 300
james: You're my roommate's replacement, huh?
# show imagecontainer james [m01-body m01-eyes-grin m01-mouth-smile01]
james: Don't worry, you don't have much to live up to. Just don't use heroin like the last guy, and you'll be fine!
# show imagecontainer james [m01-body m01-eyes-smile m01-mouth-grin00]
mc: ...

// ...
-> DONE
```

```ts tab="Typescript" title="labels/startLabel.ts" groupId="narrative_language"
const startLabel = newLabel("start", [
    // ...
], {
    onLoadingLabel: () => { // [!code focus]
        Assets.backgroundLoadBundle(["fm01", "fm02", "m01"]); // [!code focus]
    } // [!code focus]
});
export default startLabel;
```

## Use transitions

To make the visual novel more dynamic, you can use transitions to show images. You can find more information about using transitions <DynamicLink href="/start/canvas-transition">here</DynamicLink>.

This is the example:

```ink tab="ink" title="ink/start.ink" groupId="narrative_language"
=== start ===
// ...

# show image bg bg01-hallway
# show imagecontainer james [m01-body m01-eyes-smile m01-mouth-neutral01] xAlign 0.5 yAlign 1 with movein direction right speed 300
james: You're my roommate's replacement, huh?
# show imagecontainer james [m01-body m01-eyes-grin m01-mouth-smile01]
james: Don't worry, you don't have much to live up to. Just don't use heroin like the last guy, and you'll be fine!
# show imagecontainer james [m01-body m01-eyes-smile m01-mouth-grin00]
mc: ...

// ...
-> DONE
```

```ts tab="Typescript" title="labels/startLabel.ts" groupId="narrative_language"
const startLabel = newLabel("start", [
    async () => {
        await showImage("bg", "bg01-hallway");
        await moveIn(
            "james",
            {
                value: ["m01-body", "m01-eyes-smile", "m01-mouth-neutral01"],
                options: { xAlign: 0.5, yAlign: 1 },
            },
            { direction: "right", ease: "circInOut", type: "spring" }
        );
        narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `You're my roommate's replacement, huh?` };
    },
    async () => {
        await showImageContainer("james", ["m01-body", "m01-eyes-grin", "m01-mouth-smile01"]);
        narration.dialogue = {
            character: james,
            text: `Don't worry, you don't have much to live up to. Just don't use heroin like the last guy, and you'll be fine!`,
        };
    },
    async () => {
        await showImageContainer("james", ["m01-body", "m01-eyes-smile", "m01-mouth-grin00"]);
        narration.dialogue = { character: mc, text: `...` };
    },
    // ...
]);
export default startLabel;
```

## Building an animation

To make the visual novel more dynamic, you can use animations. For more information about how to use animations, see <DynamicLink href="/start/canvas-animations-effects">here</DynamicLink>.

I recommend using TypeScript if you need to set many properties, as this gives you more control, more functionality, and type feedback.

In this example, my animation will take `steph` out of the scene and reinsert her in the next `step`. I'll also mirror her on the x-axis to make sure she's facing the right way.

To take `steph` out/in, I will use the `moveOut` and `moveIn` functions. For the mirror effect, I will use the `canvas.animate` function.

First, I use the `canvas.animate` function to create an animation that sets the `scaleX` property from `-1` (mirrored) to `1`, with `autoplay: false` so it does not start immediately.

Then, I use the `moveIn` function to move `steph` into the scene, passing the `tickerId` of the animation so it can be resumed after the transition is complete.

I use the `forceCompleteBeforeNext: true` option to ensure the animation completes before the next `step` is executed. For `moveIn`, being a transition, `forceCompleteBeforeNext` is true by default.

Since I use TypeScript for this animation, I created a `label` for it, so it can be called from other languages as well.

```ts title="labels/animation01.ts"
import { canvas, ImageContainer, moveIn, newLabel } from "@drincs/pixi-vn";

export const animation01 = newLabel("animation_01", [
    async () => {
        let tickerId = canvas.animate<ImageContainer>(
            "steph",
            {
                scaleX: 1,
            },
            { autoplay: false, forceCompleteBeforeNext: true }
        );

        await moveIn(
            "steph",
            {
                value: ["fm02-body", "fm02-eyes-joy", "fm02-mouth-smile01"],
                options: { xAlign: 0.8, yAlign: 1, scale: { y: 1, x: -1 }, anchor: 0.5 },
            },
            { direction: "right", ease: "easeInOut", tickerIdToResume: tickerId }
        );
    },
]);
```

<Callout type="info" title="ink">

As explained <DynamicLink href="/ink/labels#use-the-call-script">here</DynamicLink>, from *ink* you can call `labels` written in JS/TS and vice versa.

</Callout>

Now you can call this `label` (`animation_01`) from the main `label` (`start`).

```ink tab="ink" title="ink/start.ink" groupId="narrative_language"
=== start ===
// ...

# show imagecontainer james [m01-body m01-eyes-grin m01-mouth-grin00]
# show imagecontainer sly [fm01-body fm01-eyes-smile fm01-mouth-smile00]
# show imagecontainer steph [fm02-body fm02-eyes-upset fm02-mouth-nervous00]
# remove image steph with moveout direction left speed 300
[steph_fullname] goes through the opposite door,
# call animation_01
<> and returns with a HUGE tinfoil-covered platter.

// ...
-> DONE
```

```ts tab="Typescript" title="labels/startLabel.ts" groupId="narrative_language"
const startLabel = newLabel("start", [
    // ...
    async () => {
        await showImageContainer("james", ["m01-body", "m01-eyes-grin", "m01-mouth-grin00"]);
        await showImageContainer("sly", ["fm01-body", "fm01-eyes-smile", "fm01-mouth-smile00"]);
        await showImageContainer("steph", ["fm02-body", "fm02-eyes-upset", "fm02-mouth-nervous00"]);
        moveOut("steph", { direction: "left", speed: 300 });
        narration.dialogue = `${steph_fullname} goes through the opposite door,`;
    },
    async (props) => {
        narration.dialogGlue = true;
        narration.dialogue = ` and returns with a HUGE tinfoil-covered platter.`;
        await narration.call(animation01, props);
    },
    // ...
]);
export default startLabel;
```
