description: How to define, use, and customize characters in Pixi’VN, including storage, emotions, and custom properties.
---

**What are characters?** Characters are the actors that appear in a visual novel. In Pixi’VN, characters are created using the `CharacterBaseModel` class or a [custom class](#custom-class).

## Initialize

To initialize a character, create a new instance of the `CharacterBaseModel` class (or your [custom class](#custom-class)) and add it to the game character dictionary when the game is initialized.

To create a new instance of `CharacterBaseModel`, you need the following parameters:

* `id`: A unique identifier for the character (string). It is used to reference the character in the game (must be unique). If you want to create a [character with an "emotion", you can pass an object](#character-emotions).
* `props`: An object with the character's properties:
  * `name`: The character's name.
  * `surname` (Optional): The character's surname.
  * `age` (Optional): The character's age.
  * `icon` (Optional): The character's icon image URL.
  * `color` (Optional): The character's color.

```ts title="values/characters.ts"
import { CharacterBaseModel, RegisteredCharacters } from "@drincs/pixi-vn";

export const liam = new CharacterBaseModel('liam', {
    name: 'Liam',
    surname: 'Smith',
    age: 25,
    icon: "https://example.com/liam.png",
    color: "#9e2e12"
});

export const emma = new CharacterBaseModel('emma', {
    name: 'Emma',
    surname: 'Johnson',
    age: 23,
    icon: "https://example.com/emma.png",
    color: "#9e2e12"
});

RegisteredCharacters.add([liam, emma]);
```

`RegisteredCharacters.add` is **required** to save the characters in the game.

You can also create a function to load characters. The important thing is that it is called at least once before the characters are used in the game, otherwise they will not be available.

## Get

To get a character by its `id`, use the `RegisteredCharacters.get` function.

```typescript
import { RegisteredCharacters } from "@drincs/pixi-vn";

const liam = RegisteredCharacters.get('liam');
```

## Get all

To get all characters, use the `RegisteredCharacters.values` function.

```typescript
import { RegisteredCharacters } from "@drincs/pixi-vn";

const characters = RegisteredCharacters.values();
```

## Edit

`CharacterBaseModel` is a <DynamicLink href="/start/stored-classes">stored class</DynamicLink>, which means its properties are saved in <DynamicLink href="/start/storage">game storage</DynamicLink>.

If the character's name is changed during the game, the new name will be saved in the game storage and linked to its `id`.

If the **character's `id` is changed** from one version to another, the system will **not** move the data linked from the previous `id` to the new `id`.

The properties of the `CharacterBaseModel` that are stored in the game storage are:

* `name`: The character's name.
* `surname`: The character's surname.
* `age`: The character's age.

To get the properties used when instantiating the class, you can use:

* `defaultName`: The character's name.
* `defaultSurname`: The character's surname.
* `defaultAge`: The character's age.

Here's a simplified implementation of the `CharacterBaseModel` class for better understanding of the properties that are stored in the game storage:

```typescript title="CharacterBaseModel.ts"
export default class CharacterBaseModel extends StoredClassModel implements CharacterBaseModelProps {
    constructor(id: string, props: CharacterBaseModelProps) {
        super(
            // ...
        )
        this.defaultName = props.name
        this.icon = props.icon
        // ...
    }

    // name property is stored in the game storage
    private defaultName: string = ""
    get name(): string {
        return this.getStorageProperty<string>("name") || this.defaultName
    }
    set name(value: string) {
        this.setStorageProperty<string>("name", value)
    }

    // icon property is not stored in the game storage
    icon: string = ""

    // ...
}
```

## Use

You can use a game character, for example, to <DynamicLink href="/start/dialogue#set-the-current-dialogue">link it to the current dialogue</DynamicLink>. You can use the character's `id` or the character's instance, but it is recommended to use the instance.

```ts title="values/characters.ts"
export const liam = new CharacterBaseModel('liam_id', {
    name: 'Liam',
    surname: 'Smith',
    age: 25,
    icon: "https://example.com/liam.png",
    color: "#9e2e12"
});
RegisteredCharacters.add([liam]);
```

```typescript
narration.dialogue = { character: liam, text: "Hello" }
// or
narration.dialogue = { character: "liam_id", text: "Hello" }
```

## Character emotions

It is often useful to have multiple types of the same character. For example, a character "Alice" and a subtype related to her emotional state, like "Angry Alice". The character and the subtype have the same characteristics, except for one or more properties, such as the icon.

With Pixi’VN, you can create a "character with an emotion" by passing an object instead of the id, with the following properties:

* `id`: The id of an existing character.
* `emotion`: The character's subcategory (e.g. the character's emotion).

```ts title="values/characters.ts"
import { CharacterBaseModel, RegisteredCharacters } from "@drincs/pixi-vn";

export const alice = new CharacterBaseModel('alice', {
    name: 'Alice',
    icon: "https://example.com/alice.png",
    color: "#9e2e12"
});

export const angryAlice = new CharacterBaseModel({ id: 'alice', emotion: 'angry' }, {
    icon: "https://example.com/angryAlice.png",
});

RegisteredCharacters.add([alice, angryAlice]);
```

```typescript
console.log(alice.name); // Alice

alice.name = "Eleonora";
console.log(alice.name); // Eleonora
console.log(angryAlice.name); // Eleonora

angryAlice.name = "Angry Eleonora";
console.log(alice.name); // Eleonora
console.log(angryAlice.name); // Angry Eleonora
```

## Custom class

<Callout title="Templates" type="info">
In all templates, the `Character` class is already defined in the file `models/Character.ts`. You can use it directly or modify it to suit your needs.
</Callout>

It is recommended to create your own class `Character` that extends `CharacterStoredClass` and "override" the interface `CharacterInterface` to add, edit, or remove properties or methods.

For example, if you want to create a class `Character`, you must "override" the interface `CharacterInterface` to use your properties or methods. (See the file `pixi-vn.d.ts`)

Now you can create a class `Character` that extends `CharacterStoredClass` and implements the `CharacterInterface`. (For more information on how to create a class in TypeScript, read [the official documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/classes.html))

To create a property that stores its value in the game storage, you can create [Getters/Setters](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/classes.html#getters--setters) and use the `this.getStorageProperty()`/`this.setStorageProperty()` methods. (See the file `Character.ts`)

```ts tab="models/Character.ts"
import { CharacterInterface, CharacterStoredClass } from "@drincs/pixi-vn";

export class Character extends CharacterStoredClass implements CharacterInterface {
    constructor(id: string | { id: string, emotion: string }, props: CharacterProps) {
        super(typeof id === "string" ? id : id.id, typeof id === "string" ? "" : id.emotion)
        this._icon = props.icon
        this._color = props.color
        this.defaultName = props.name
        this.defaultSurname = props.surname
        this.defaultAge = props.age
    }

    // Not stored properties
    
    readonly icon?: string;
    readonly color?: string | undefined;

    // Stored properties

    private defaultName?: string
    get name(): string {
        return this.getStorageProperty<string>("name") || this.defaultName || this.id
    }
    set name(value: string | undefined) {
        this.setStorageProperty<string>("name", value)
    }
    private defaultSurname?: string
    get surname(): string | undefined {
        return this.getStorageProperty<string>("surname") || this.defaultSurname
    }
    set surname(value: string | undefined) {
        this.setStorageProperty<string>("surname", value)
    }
    private defaultAge?: number | undefined
    get age(): number | undefined {
        return this.getStorageProperty<number>("age") || this.defaultAge
    }
    set age(value: number | undefined) {
        this.setStorageProperty<number>("age", value)
    }
}

interface CharacterProps {
    /**
     * The name of the character.
     */
    name?: string;
    /**
     * The surname of the character.
     */
    surname?: string;
    /**
     * The age of the character.
     */
    age?: number;
    /**
     * The icon of the character.
     */
    icon?: string;
    /**
     * The color of the character.
     */
    color?: string;
}
```

```ts tab="pixi-vn.d.ts"
declare module '@drincs/pixi-vn' {
    interface CharacterInterface {
        /**
         * The name of the character.
         * If you set undefined, it will return the default name.
         */
        name: string;
        /**
         * The surname of the character.
         * If you set undefined, it will return the default surname.
         */
        surname?: string;
        /**
         * The age of the character.
         * If you set undefined, it will return the default age.
         */
        age?: number;
        /**
         * The icon of the character.
         */
        readonly icon?: string;
        /**
         * The color of the character.
         */
        readonly color?: string;
    }
}
```
