title: Labels and steps
---

Visual Novels are usually a succession of screenshots with images and text.

<Callout title="Nomenclature" type="info">
The term `label` was taken from Ren'Py. This name derives from their function, which is to act as true "bookmarks" or "landmarks." In the ink language, the term `label` corresponds to `knot`.

The term `step` was introduced by Pixi'VN to represent the individual actions or events that occur within a label.
</Callout>

In Pixiâ€™VN the entire narrative flow is based on the concept of `labels` and `steps`.

The `labels` are used to organize the narrative, in short, they work as "bookmarks". On the technical side, `labels` are classes that act as containers for `steps`.

The `steps` are the individual actions or events that occur within a label. They can be used to display images, text, and other elements of the narrative.

Basically the idea of the life cycle of the game is:

* The game starts by <DynamicLink href="/start/labels#call-a-label">calling a label</DynamicLink>. The first step of the label will be executed automatically.
* After that, connecting the function <DynamicLink href="/start/labels#next-step">Next Step</DynamicLink> to a event (like a button click), every time the function is called, the next step of the label is executed.
Some steps could start other labels.
* The game will end only when all the steps are completed. The <DynamicLink href="/start/other-narrative-features#how-manage-the-end-of-the-game">Game.onEnd</DynamicLink> function will be started.

## Label

The label is a container of steps. It is used to organize the steps in a more readable way.

For create a label you must use the `newLabel()` function and pass:

* The `id` of the label, must be unique
* The `steps` of the label, an array of functions that will be executed in order. Or a function that returns the array of functions.
* The `options` of the label, an object with the following properties:
  * `onStepStart`: A function that will be executed before each step of the label. You can read more about it <DynamicLink href="/start/labels-advanced#onstepstart">here</DynamicLink>.
  * `onStepEnd`: A function that will be executed after each step of the label. You can read more about it <DynamicLink href="/start/labels-advanced#onstepend">here</DynamicLink>.
  * `onLoadingLabel`: A function that will be executed in `onStepStart` if the index of the step is 0 and when the user loads a save file. You can read more about it <DynamicLink href="/start/labels-advanced#onloadinglabel">here</DynamicLink>.

```ts title="labels/startLabel.ts"
import { narration } from '@drincs/pixi-vn'

export const startLabel = newLabel("start_label",
    [
        () => {
            narration.dialogue = { character: liam, text: "Example of dialogue" }
        },
        (props, { labelId }) => narration.jumpLabel(labelId, props),
    ]
)
```

### Override `StepLabelProps`

All the <DynamicLink href="/start/labels-flow">functionality to control the flow of labels</DynamicLink> requires an object that corresponds to the `StepLabelProps` interface. The object will be passed as a parameter to the step that will be executed.

By default `StepLabelProps` corresponds to `{ [key: string]: any }`. You can "override" the `StepLabelProps` interface in the `.d.ts` file to set required parameters.

```ts tab="pixi-vn.d.ts"
import { narration } from '@drincs/pixi-vn'

declare module '@drincs/pixi-vn' {
    interface StepLabelProps {
        navigate: (route: string) => void,
    }
}
```

```ts tab="labels/startLabel.ts"
export const startLabel = newLabel("start_label",
    [
        () => {
            return narration.callLabel(testLabel, { // [!code focus]
                navigate: (route) => { // [!code focus]
                    // navigate to route // [!code focus]
                } // [!code focus]
            }) // [!code focus]
        },
    ]
)
```

### Parameters of the label steps

You can pass a type to `newLabel` function for add other parameters in addition to [`StepLabelProps`](#override-steplabelprops), for that label.

```ts title="labels/startLabel.ts"
import { narration } from '@drincs/pixi-vn'

export const startLabel = newLabel<{name: string}>("start_label",
    [
        (props) => {
            console.log(props.name)
        },
    ]
)

narration.callLabel(startLabel, {
    // add StepLabelProps here
    navigate: navigate, // example
    // and the props that will be passed to the label
    name: "John"
})
```

### All Steps Result

The steps can return a `StepLabelResult` object, by default the `StepLabelResult` object is a `{ [key: string]: any }`.

You can "override" the `StepLabelResult` interface in the `.d.ts` file to set your custom properties in the result of the steps.

```ts tab="pixi-vn.d.ts"
declare module '@drincs/pixi-vn' {
    interface StepLabelResult {
        newRoute?: string,
        [key: string]: any
    }
}
```

```ts tab="labels/startLabel.ts"
export const startLabel = newLabel("start_label",
    [
        () => {
            return { // [!code focus]
                newRoute: '/new-route', // [!code focus]
                customProperty: 12 // [!code focus]
            } // [!code focus]
        },
    ]
)
```

## Step limit saved

At each step all the information of the current state of the game is <DynamicLink href="/start/save">saved</DynamicLink>.

To avoid the size of the save file growing too much, there is a limit of 100 steps saved, by default is 20 steps. When the limit is reached, only essential information from old steps will be kept.
This basic information allows you to show the entire <DynamicLink href="/start/history">history of the narrative</DynamicLink>, but without the possibility of <DynamicLink href="/start/labels-flow#go-back">returning</DynamicLink> to a specific step.

You can edit the limit of steps saved by changing the `stepLimitSaved` property in the `narration` object.

```typescript
import { stepHistory } from '@drincs/pixi-vn'

stepHistory.stepLimitSaved = 100
```

If you want to disable the limit of steps saved, you can set the `stepLimitSaved` property to `Infinity`.

```typescript
import { stepHistory } from '@drincs/pixi-vn'

stepHistory.stepLimitSaved = Infinity
```
