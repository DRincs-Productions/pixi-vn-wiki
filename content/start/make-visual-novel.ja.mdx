title: Make your first Visual Novel
description: Pixi’VNを使って、プロジェクト設定、物語、アセット、およびインタラクティビティを網羅したビジュアルノベルの作成に関するステップバイステップのガイドです。
---

import { TSVisualNovelExample } from "@/components/vn-examples";

このチュートリアルでは、最初のビジュアルノベルを作成するプロセスを案内します。

**ビジュアルノベルとは何ですか？** ビジュアルノベル（VN）は、デジタルインタラクティブフィクションの一形態です。 ビジュアルノベルはしばしばビデオゲームのメディアと関連付けられますが、必ずしもそのようにラベル付けされるわけではありません。 They combine a textual narrative with static or animated illustrations and a varying degree of interactivity. The format is more rarely referred to as novel game, a retranscription of the wasei-eigo term noberu gēmu (ノベルゲーム), which is more often used in Japanese.

テスト目的のために、このガイドではPixi’VNを使用してビジュアルノベル[Breakdown](https://joshpowlison.itch.io/breakdown)を再現します。 Breakdownは、ビジュアルノベルが持つべきすべての特徴を備えた短編小説です。 BreakdownのクリエイターであるJosh Powlisonは、教育目的で彼のナarrationを使用することを許可してくれました❤️。

Pixi’VNは、1つ以上の<DynamicLink href="/start/narration">利用可能なナarration言語</DynamicLink>を選択することで、自分自身のナarrationを書く能力を提供します。そのため、各開発ステップで現在利用可能な言語ごとに例を作成します。

## 新しいプロジェクトを作成する

最初のステップは、新しいプロジェクトを作成することです。 You can find more information on how to create a new project starting from a template <DynamicLink href="/start#project-initialization">here</DynamicLink>. 「ビジュアルノベル - React」というテンプレートを使用します。

`Visual Novel -> React`

作成が完了したら、プロジェクトのルートにある `README.md` ファイルを読むことが非常に重要です。 このファイルには、プロジェクトに関する重要な情報とその使用方法が含まれています。

私たちの場合、プロジェクトを開始するには、次のコマンドを実行するだけで済みます。

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## キャラクターの作成

これからこの物語のキャラクターを定義します。 これを行うために、`/values/characters.ts` ファイルで使用するキャラクターを定義します。 キャラクターの作成と使用に関する詳細情報は、<DynamicLink href="/start/character">キャラクター</DynamicLink>を参照してください。

`mc`とは何ですか？ `mc`は「メインキャラクター」の一般的な略語です。 ビジュアルノベルでは、`mc`をメインキャラクターの名前として使用するのが一般的な方法です。

```ts tab="values/characters.ts"
import { RegisteredCharacters } from "@drincs/pixi-vn";
import Character from "../models/Character";

export const mc = new Character('mc', {
    name: 'Me',
});

export const james = new Character('james', {
    name: 'James',
    color: "#0084ac"
});

export const steph = new Character('steph', {
    name: 'Steph',
    color: "#ac5900"
});

export const sly = new Character('sly', {
    name: 'Sly',
    color: "#6d00ac"
});

RegisteredCharacters.add([mc, james, steph, sly]);
```

```ts tab="App.tsx"
// Remember to import the character file at least once into your project. // [!code focus]
import "./values/characters"; // [!code focus]

export default function App() {
return // ...
}
```

## 物語の初稿

<Callout title="Markup" type="info">

すべてのテンプレートは <DynamicLink href="/start/markup-markdown">Markdown</DynamicLink> と <DynamicLink href="/start/markup-tailwindcss">Tailwind CSS</DynamicLink> をサポートしているため、私たちはナarrationにそれを使用します。

</Callout>

これで、ビジュアルノベルの<DynamicLink href="/start/narration">ナarration</DynamicLink>の「初稿」を書き始めることができます。
最初の<DynamicLink href="/start/labels">`label`</DynamicLink>を `start` として作成します。これがゲームの始まりになります。 After that we can write the <DynamicLink href="/start/dialogue">dialogues</DynamicLink> that will follow in our visual novel.

This is the example:

```ink tab="ink" title="ink/start.ink" groupId="narrative_language"
=== start ===
james: You're my roommate's replacement, huh?
james: Don't worry, you don't have much to live up to. Just don't use heroin like the last guy, and you' fine!
mc: ...

He thrusts out his hand.

james: James!
mc: ...Peter.

I take his hand and shake.

james: Ooh, Peter! Nice, firm handshake! The last quy always gave me the dead fish. I already think we'r gonna get along fine.
james: Come on in and... 
james: ...
james: I know you're both watching, come on out already!

sly: I just wanted to see what the new guy was like. Hey, you, Peter- be nice to our little brother, or you'll have to deal with *us*.
mc: ...
james: Peter, this is Sly. Yes, that is her real name.

I put out my hand.

sly: I'm not shakin' your hand until I decide you're an all-right dude. Sorry, policy.
mc: Fair enough, I'm a pretty scary guy, or so l've been told.
james: The redhead behind her is Stephanie.
// Example of using Tailwind CSS
steph: <span class="inline-block motion-translate-y-loop-25">Hey</span>! Everyone calls me Steph. I'll shake your hand.

// ...
-> DONE
```

```ts tab="Typescript" title="labels/startLabel.ts" groupId="narrative_language"
const startLabel = newLabel("start", [
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `You're my roommate's replacement, huh?` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `Don't worry, you don't have much to live up to. Just don't use heroin like the last guy, and you' fine!` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: mc, text: `...` },
    () => { narration.dialogue = "He thrusts out his hand." },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `James!` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: mc, text: `...Peter.` },
    () => { narration.dialogue = "I take his hand and shake." },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `Ooh, Peter! Nice, firm handshake! The last quy always gave me the dead fish. I already think we'r gonna get along fine.` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `Come on in and...` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `...` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `I know you're both watching, come on out already!` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `I just wanted to see what the new guy was like. Hey, you, Peter- be nice to our little brother, or you'll have to deal with *us*.` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: mc, text: `...` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `Peter, this is Sly. Yes, that is her real name.` },
    () => { narration.dialogue = "I put out my hand." },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `I'm not shakin' your hand until I decide you're an all-right dude. Sorry, policy.` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: mc, text: `Fair enough, I'm a pretty scary guy, or so l've been told.` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `The redhead behind her is Stephanie.` },
    // Example of using Tailwind CSS
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: steph, text: `<span class="inline-block motion-translate-y-loop-25">Hey</span>! Everyone calls me Steph. I'll shake your hand.` },
    // ...
]);
export default startLabel;
```

### Split the narrative into labels

It is not advisable to create very long `labels` (even for linear visual novels), but it is advisable to create multiple small `labels` and "call" them when needed with the <DynamicLink href="/start/labels-flow">narration flow control features</DynamicLink>.

For this reason, even if in our case our story is linear, it will be divided into two `labels`, the first will be the one we just created, while the second will be called `second_part`.

This is the example:

```ink tab="ink" title="ink/start.ink" groupId="narrative_language"
=== start ===
james: You're my roommate's replacement, huh?
james: Don't worry, you don't have much to live up to. Just don't use heroin like the last guy, and you' fine!
mc: ...

He thrusts out his hand.

james: James!
mc: ...Peter.

// ...
-> second_part

=== second_part ===

She enters my room before I'VE even had a chance to. \\n\\n...I could've just come back and gotten the platter later...
She sets it on a desk. I throw my two paper bags down beside the empty bed.

steph: They got you a new mattress, right? That last guy was a druggie, did James tell you that?
sly: *We're* the reason he got expelled!
steph: Sly! If word gets out about that... well, actually, it wouldn't matter, *he's* the one who shot himself up.

I'm fumbling for a new subject.

// ...
-> DONE
```

```ts tab="Typescript" title="labels/startLabel.ts" groupId="narrative_language"
const startLabel = newLabel("start", [
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `You're my roommate's replacement, huh?` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `Don't worry, you don't have much to live up to. Just don't use heroin like the last guy, and you' fine!` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: mc, text: `...` },
    () => { narration.dialogue = "He thrusts out his hand." },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `James!` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: mc, text: `...Peter.` },
    // ...
    async (props) => await narration.jumpLabel(secondPart, props),
]);
export default startLabel;

const secondPart = newLabel("second_part", [
    () => { narration.dialogue = `She enters my room before I'VE even had a chance to. \n\n...I could've just come back and gotten the platter later...` },
    () => { narration.dialogue = `She sets it on a desk. I throw my two paper bags down beside the empty bed.` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: steph, text: `They got you a new mattress, right? That last guy was a druggie, did James tell you that?` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: sly, text: `*We're* the reason he got expelled!` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: steph, text: `Sly! If word gets out about that... well, actually, it wouldn't matter, *he's* the one who shot himself up.` },
    () => { narration.dialogue = `I'm fumbling for a new subject.` },
    // ...
]);
```

## Choice menus

Now we will ask the player if he wants to continue with the second part of the visual novel.

To do this, we will use the <DynamicLink href="/start/choices">choice menu</DynamicLink>.

This is the example:

```ink tab="ink" title="ink/start.ink" groupId="narrative_language"
=== start ===
// ...

You want continue to the next part?
* Yes, I want to continue
-> second_part
* No, I want to stop here
-> END

=== second_part ===

// ...
-> DONE
```

```ts tab="Typescript" title="labels/startLabel.ts" groupId="narrative_language"
const startLabel = newLabel("start", [
    // ...
    async () => {
        narration.dialogue = `You want continue to the next part?`
        narration.choiceMenuOptions = [
            newChoiceOption("Yes, I want to continue", secondPart, {}, { type: "jump" }),
            newCloseChoiceOption("No, I want to stop here"),
        ]
    },
]);
export default startLabel;

const secondPart = newLabel("second_part", [
    // ...
]);
```

## Edit character information and use it as a variable

Now I will give the player the ability to change the name of the `mc`.

To do this, I will ask the player to <DynamicLink href="/start/input">complete an input box using Pixi’VN's features</DynamicLink>.

After getting the input value, you can <DynamicLink href="/start/character#edit">set the character name</DynamicLink> using the obtained value.

This is the example:

```ink tab="ink" title="ink/start.ink" groupId="narrative_language"
VAR _input_value_ = ""

=== start ===
// ...

He thrusts out his hand.
# request input type string default Peter
What is your name?
# rename mc { _input_value_ }

// ...
-> DONE
```

```ts tab="Typescript" title="labels/startLabel.ts" groupId="narrative_language"
const startLabel = newLabel("start", [
    // ...
    () => { narration.dialogue = `He thrusts out his hand.` },
    () => {
        narration.requestInput({ type: "string" }, "Peter")
        narration.dialogue = `What is your name?`
    },
    () => {
        mc.name = narration.inputValue as string
    },
    // ...
]);
export default startLabel;
```

Now we could <DynamicLink href="/start/character#use">use character names</DynamicLink> within dialogues.

This is the example:

```ink tab="ink" title="ink/start.ink" groupId="narrative_language"
VAR steph_fullname = "Stephanie"

=== start ===
// ...

sly: I just wanted to see what the new guy was like. Hey, you, [mc]- be nice to our little brother, or you'll have to deal with *us*.
mc: ...
james: [mc], this is [sly]. Yes, that is her real name.

I put out my hand.

sly: I'm not shakin' your hand until I decide you're an all-right dude. Sorry, policy.
mc: Fair enough, I'm a pretty scary guy, or so l've been told.
james: The redhead behind her is [steph_fullname].
steph: Hey! Everyone calls me [steph]. I'll shake your hand.

She puts out her hand, and I take it.

mc: Thanks, good to meet you, [steph_fullname].
steph: WOW, that is, like, the most perfect handshake I've ever had! Firm, but also gentle. [sly], you *gotta* shake his hand!

// ...
-> DONE
```

```ts tab="Typescript" title="labels/startLabel.ts" groupId="narrative_language"
const steph_fullname = "Stephanie";

const startLabel = newLabel("start", [
    // ...
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: sly, text: `I just wanted to see what the new guy was like. Hey, you, ${mc.name}- be nice to our little brother, or you'll have to deal with *us*.` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: mc, text: `...` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `${mc.name}, this is ${sly.name}. Yes, that is her real name.` },
    () => { narration.dialogue = `I put out my hand.` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: sly, text: `I'm not shakin' your hand until I decide you're an all-right dude. Sorry, policy.` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: mc, text: `Fair enough, I'm a pretty scary guy, or so I've been told.` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `The redhead behind her is ${steph_fullname}.` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: steph, text: `Hey! Everyone calls me ${steph.name}. I'll shake your hand.` },
    () => { narration.dialogue = `She puts out her hand, and I take it.` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: mc, text: `Thanks, good to meet you, ${steph_fullname}.` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: steph, text: `WOW, that is, like, the most perfect handshake I've ever had! Firm, but also gentle. ${sly.name}, you *gotta* shake his hand!` },
    // ...
]);
export default startLabel;
```

## Use the "glue" feature of dialogues

In visual novels, it is often useful to paste text into the current dialogue. For example, to pause a conversation and have it continue in a subsequent `step`. To do this, we can use the <DynamicLink href="/start/dialogue#dialogue-glue">glue functionality</DynamicLink>.

This is the example:

```ink tab="ink" title="ink/start.ink" groupId="narrative_language"
=== start ===
// ...

james: Ooh, [mc]! Nice, firm handshake!
<>The last guy always gave me the dead fish.
<>I already think we're gonna get along fine.
james: Come on in and...

// ...
-> DONE
```

```ts tab="Typescript" title="labels/startLabel.ts" groupId="narrative_language"
const startLabel = newLabel("start", [
    // ...
    async () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `Ooh, ${mc.name}! Nice, firm handshake!` },
    async () => {
        narration.dialogGlue = true
        narration.dialogue = `The last guy always gave me the dead fish.`
    },
    async () => {
        narration.dialogGlue = true
        narration.dialogue = `I already think we're gonna get along fine.`
    },
    async () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `Come on in and...` },
    // ...
]);
export default startLabel;
```

## Define assets and load them

<Callout type="info">

To load and manipulate assets (images, gifs, videos...) you will need to use `Assets`. `Assets` is a class with many features and comes from the PixiJS library, if you want more information read [here](https://pixijs.com/8.x/guides/components/assets).

</Callout>

One of the first steps is choosing where to save your visual novel assets. In this case, we will save the assets in the Firebase storage (a hosting service). You can use any hosting service you prefer or even save the assets locally in the project, read more about it <DynamicLink href="/start/assets">here</DynamicLink>.

Before using an asset it is highly recommended to <DynamicLink href="/start/assets-management#initialize-the-asset-matrix-at-project-start">initialize the asset matrix</DynamicLink>.

By default, as you can see in the `assets/manifest.ts` file, all templates in the `onLoadingLabel` try to load in the background the "bundle assets" with the alias equal to the current `label` id. So it is recommended to add, in the `manifest`, a "bundle assets" for each `label` with the alias equal to the `label` id and containing the images used in that `label`.

This is the example:

```ts tab="assets/manifest.ts"
import { AssetsManifest } from "@drincs/pixi-vn";
import { MAIN_MENU_ROUTE } from "../constans";

/**
 * Manifest for the assets used in the game.
 * You can read more about the manifest here: https://pixijs.com/8.x/guides/components/assets#loading-multiple-assets
 */
const manifest: AssetsManifest = {
    bundles: [
        // screens
        {
            name: MAIN_MENU_ROUTE,
            assets: [
                {
                    alias: "background_main_menu",
                    src: "https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pixi-vn.appspot.com/o/public%2Fmain-menu.webp?alt=media",
                },
            ],
        },
        // labels
        {
            name: "start",
            assets: [
                {
                    alias: "bg01-hallway",
                    src: "https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pixi-vn.appspot.com/o/public%2Fbreakdown%2Fbg01-hallway.webp?alt=media",
                },
            ],
        },
        {
            name: "second_part",
            assets: [
                {
                    alias: "bg02-dorm",
                    src: "https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pixi-vn.appspot.com/o/public%2Fbreakdown%2Fbg02-dorm.webp?alt=media",
                },
            ],
        },
        // characters
        {
            name: "fm01",
            assets: [
                {
                    alias: "fm01-body",
                    src: "https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pixi-vn.appspot.com/o/public%2Fbreakdown%2Ffm01%2Ffm01-body.webp?alt=media",
                },

 * This function will be called before the game starts.

 */
export async function defineAssets() {
    Assets.init({ manifest });

    // The game will not start until these asserts are loaded.
    await Assets.loadBundle("main_menu");

    // The game will start immediately, but these asserts will be loaded in the background.
    // Assets.backgroundLoadBundle("main_menu");
    // Assets.backgroundLoad("background_main_menu");
}
```

```ts tab="src/main.ts"
import { Assets, canvas, Container, Game } from "@drincs/pixi-vn";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";
import { CANVAS_UI_LAYER_NAME } from "./constans";
import "./index.css";
import "./values/characters";

// ...

Game.onLoadingLabel((_stepId, { id }) => { // [!code focus]
    Assets.backgroundLoadBundle(id); // [!code focus]
}); // [!code focus]
```

## Add background and character images

Now it's time to think about the visual part too. We will add the background and character sprites to the visual novel canvas.

**What is a sprite?** In computer graphics, a sprite is a two-dimensional bitmap that is integrated into a larger scene, most often in a 2D video game.

In our case the character sprites are composed of 3 images: the body, the eyes and the mouth. Then we use <DynamicLink href="/start/canvas-image-container">ImageContainer</DynamicLink> to compose the character. You can find more information on how to add canvas components in <DynamicLink href="/start/canvas-components">this documentation</DynamicLink>.

This is the example:

```ink tab="ink" title="ink/start.ink" groupId="narrative_language"
=== start ===
# show image bg bg01-hallway
# show imagecontainer james [m01-body m01-eyes-smile m01-mouth-neutral01] xAlign 0.5 yAlign 1
james: You're my roommate's replacement, huh?
# show imagecontainer james [m01-body m01-eyes-grin m01-mouth-smile01]
james: Don't worry, you don't have much to live up to. Just don't use heroin like the last guy, and you'll be fine!
# show imagecontainer james [m01-body m01-eyes-smile m01-mouth-grin00]
mc: ...

// ...
-> DONE
```

```ts tab="Typescript" title="labels/startLabel.ts" groupId="narrative_language"
const startLabel = newLabel("start", [
    async () => {
        await showImage("bg", "bg01-hallway");
        await showImageContainer("james", ["m01-body", "m01-eyes-smile", "m01-mouth-neutral01"], { xAlign: 0.5, yAlign: 1 });
        narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `You're my roommate's replacement, huh?` }
    },
    async () => {
        await showImageContainer("james", ["m01-body", "m01-eyes-grin", "m01-mouth-smile01"])
        narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `Don't worry, you don't have much to live up to. Just don't use heroin like the last guy, and you'll be fine!` }
    },
    async () => {
        await showImageContainer("james", ["m01-body", "m01-eyes-smile", "m01-mouth-grin00"])
        narration.dialogue = { character: mc, text: `...` }
    },
    // ...
]);
export default startLabel;
```

## Smart asset loading

In our case we saved the game images on a hosting service (Firebase). For this reason the asset loading is not timely.

In order for the player not to perceive too many loadings we should group them in certain phases of the game. In my case I will load the most used images at the start of the `label`.

You can find more information on how to manage the loadings <DynamicLink href="/start/assets-management">here</DynamicLink>.

This is the example:

```ink tab="ink" title="ink/start.ink" groupId="narrative_language"
=== start ===
# lazyload bundle m01 fm01 fm02 // [!code focus]

# show image bg bg01-hallway
# show imagecontainer james [m01-body m01-eyes-smile m01-mouth-neutral01] xAlign 0.5 yAlign 1 with movein direction right speed 300
james: You're my roommate's replacement, huh?
# show imagecontainer james [m01-body m01-eyes-grin m01-mouth-smile01]
james: Don't worry, you don't have much to live up to. Just don't use heroin like the last guy, and you'll be fine!
# show imagecontainer james [m01-body m01-eyes-smile m01-mouth-grin00]
mc: ...

// ...
-> DONE
```

```ts tab="Typescript" title="labels/startLabel.ts" groupId="narrative_language"
const startLabel = newLabel("start", [
    // ...
], {
    onLoadingLabel: () => { // [!code focus]
        Assets.backgroundLoadBundle(["fm01", "fm02", "m01"]); // [!code focus]
    } // [!code focus]
});
export default startLabel;
```

## Use transitions

To make the visual novel more dynamic, you can use transitions to show images. You can find more information about using transitions <DynamicLink href="/start/canvas-transition">here</DynamicLink>.

This is the example:

```ink tab="ink" title="ink/start.ink" groupId="narrative_language"
=== start ===
// ...

# show image bg bg01-hallway
# show imagecontainer james [m01-body m01-eyes-smile m01-mouth-neutral01] xAlign 0.5 yAlign 1 with movein direction right speed 300
james: You're my roommate's replacement, huh?
# show imagecontainer james [m01-body m01-eyes-grin m01-mouth-smile01]
james: Don't worry, you don't have much to live up to. Just don't use heroin like the last guy, and you'll be fine!
# show imagecontainer james [m01-body m01-eyes-smile m01-mouth-grin00]
mc: ...

// ...
-> DONE
```

```ts tab="Typescript" title="labels/startLabel.ts" groupId="narrative_language"
const startLabel = newLabel("start", [
    async () => {
        await showImage("bg", "bg01-hallway");
        await moveIn(
            "james",
            {
                value: ["m01-body", "m01-eyes-smile", "m01-mouth-neutral01"],
                options: { xAlign: 0.5, yAlign: 1 },
            },
            { direction: "right", ease: "circInOut", type: "spring" }
        );
        narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `You're my roommate's replacement, huh?` };
    },
    async () => {
        await showImageContainer("james", ["m01-body", "m01-eyes-grin", "m01-mouth-smile01"]);
        narration.dialogue = {
            character: james,
            text: `Don't worry, you don't have much to live up to. Just don't use heroin like the last guy, and you'll be fine!`,
        };
    },
    async () => {
        await showImageContainer("james", ["m01-body", "m01-eyes-smile", "m01-mouth-grin00"]);
        narration.dialogue = { character: mc, text: `...` };
    },
    // ...
]);
export default startLabel;
```

## Building an animation

To make the visual novel more dynamic, you can use animations. For more information about how to use animations, see <DynamicLink href="/start/canvas-animations-effects">here</DynamicLink>.

I recommend using TypeScript if you need to set many properties, as this gives you more control, more functionality, and type feedback.

In this example, my animation will take `steph` out of the scene and reinsert her in the next `step`. I'll also mirror her on the x-axis to make sure she's facing the right way.

To take `steph` out/in, I will use the `moveOut` and `moveIn` functions. For the mirror effect, I will use the `canvas.animate` function.

First, I use the `canvas.animate` function to create an animation that sets the `scaleX` property from `-1` (mirrored) to `1`, with `autoplay: false` so it does not start immediately.

Then, I use the `moveIn` function to move `steph` into the scene, passing the `tickerId` of the animation so it can be resumed after the transition is complete.

I use the `forceCompleteBeforeNext: true` option to ensure the animation completes before the next `step` is executed. For `moveIn`, being a transition, `forceCompleteBeforeNext` is true by default.

Since I use TypeScript for this animation, I created a `label` for it, so it can be called from other languages as well.

```ts title="labels/animation01.ts"
import { canvas, ImageContainer, moveIn, newLabel } from "@drincs/pixi-vn";

export const animation01 = newLabel("animation_01", [
    async () => {
        let tickerId = canvas.animate<ImageContainer>(
            "steph",
            {
                scaleX: 1,
            },
            { autoplay: false, forceCompleteBeforeNext: true }
        );

        await moveIn(
            "steph",
            {
                value: ["fm02-body", "fm02-eyes-joy", "fm02-mouth-smile01"],
                options: { xAlign: 0.8, yAlign: 1, scale: { y: 1, x: -1 }, anchor: 0.5 },
            },
            { direction: "right", ease: "easeInOut", tickerIdToResume: tickerId }
        );
    },
]);
```

Now you can call this `label` (`animation_01`) from the main `label` (`start`). (As explained <DynamicLink href="/ink/ink-label#use-the-call-script">here</DynamicLink>, from _ink_ you can call `labels` written in ts and vice versa.)

```ink tab="ink" title="ink/start.ink" groupId="narrative_language"
=== start ===
// ...

# show imagecontainer james [m01-body m01-eyes-grin m01-mouth-grin00]
# show imagecontainer sly [fm01-body fm01-eyes-smile fm01-mouth-smile00]
# show imagecontainer steph [fm02-body fm02-eyes-upset fm02-mouth-nervous00]
# remove image steph with moveout direction left speed 300
[steph_fullname] goes through the opposite door,
# call animation_01
<> and returns with a HUGE tinfoil-covered platter.

// ...
-> DONE
```

```ts tab="Typescript" title="labels/startLabel.ts" groupId="narrative_language"
const startLabel = newLabel("start", [
    // ...
    async () => {
        await showImageContainer("james", ["m01-body", "m01-eyes-grin", "m01-mouth-grin00"]);
        await showImageContainer("sly", ["fm01-body", "fm01-eyes-smile", "fm01-mouth-smile00"]);
        await showImageContainer("steph", ["fm02-body", "fm02-eyes-upset", "fm02-mouth-nervous00"]);
        moveOut("steph", { direction: "left", speed: 300 });
        narration.dialogue = `${steph_fullname} goes through the opposite door,`;
    },
    async (props) => {
        narration.dialogGlue = true;
        narration.dialogue = ` and returns with a HUGE tinfoil-covered platter.`;
        await narration.callLabel(animation01, props);
    },
    // ...
]);
export default startLabel;
```
