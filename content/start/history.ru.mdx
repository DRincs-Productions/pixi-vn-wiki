Pixi’VN saves all dialogues, choices, responses and more, at every `step` executed during the game.

## Get

The narration timeline is a list of all dialogues and choices shown to the player.\
To get the narrative history, use `stepHistory.narrativeHistory`. It returns a list of `NarrativeHistory<T>[]`.

```typescript
const dialogues: NarrativeHistory[] = stepHistory.narrativeHistory;
```

## Remove

To delete all narrative history, use `stepHistory.removeNarrativeHistory()`.

```typescript
stepHistory.removeNarrativeHistory();
```

To delete part of the narrative history, pass a number to remove the first N elements:

```typescript
// Delete the first 2 elements
stepHistory.removeNarrativeHistory(2);
```

## Другие возможности

<Accordions>

<Accordion title="limit_saved_steps" id="limit-saved-steps">

At each `step`, all information about the current game state is saved.

To prevent the save file from growing too large, there is a limit on the number of `steps` saved. By default, only the last 20 `steps` are saved, but you can increase this limit (e.g., to 100). When the limit is reached, only essential information from older `steps` is kept. This allows you to display the full <DynamicLink href="/start/history">narrative history</DynamicLink>, but you cannot <DynamicLink href="/start/labels-flow#go-back">return</DynamicLink> to a specific `step` beyond the limit.

You can change the `step` save limit by setting the `stepLimitSaved` property in the `stepHistory` object.

```typescript
import { stepHistory } from '@drincs/pixi-vn'

stepHistory.stepLimitSaved = 100
```

To disable the `step` save limit, set `stepLimitSaved` to `Infinity`.

```typescript
import { stepHistory } from '@drincs/pixi-vn'

stepHistory.stepLimitSaved = Infinity
```
