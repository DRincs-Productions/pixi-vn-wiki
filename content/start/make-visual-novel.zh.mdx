title: Make your first Visual Novel
description: 使用 Pixi’VN 创建视觉小说的逐步指南，涵盖项目设置、叙事、资产和交互。
---

import { TSVisualNovelExample } from "@/components/vn-examples";

本教程将指导您完成创建第一个视觉小说的过程。

**什么是视觉小说？** 视觉小说（VN）是一种数字互动小说的形式。 视觉小说通常与视频游戏这一媒介相关联，但并不总是被如此标记。 它们将文本叙事与静态或动画插图结合在一起，并具有不同程度的互动性。 这种格式较少被称为小说游戏，这是对和制英语术语 noberu gēmu（ノベルゲーム）的转录，这个术语在日语中更为常用。

出于测试目的，本指南将使用 Pixi’VN 重新创建视觉小说 [Breakdown](https://joshpowlison.itch.io/breakdown)。 《Breakdown》是一个短篇故事，具有视觉小说应具备的所有特征。 《Breakdown》的创作者乔什·保利森（Josh Powlison）已允许我们出于教育目的使用他的旁白❤️。

由于 Pixi’VN 允许您通过选择一种或多种 <DynamicLink href="/start/narration">可用叙事语言</DynamicLink> 来编写自己的旁白，因此在每个开发步骤中将提供当前可用语言的示例。

## 创建一个新项目

第一步是创建一个新项目。 You can find more information on how to create a new project starting from a template <DynamicLink href="/start#project-initialization">here</DynamicLink>. 我们将使用模板 "Visual Novel - React"。

`Visual Novel -> React`

创建完成后，阅读项目根目录中的 `README.md` 文件非常重要。 该文件包含有关项目及其使用的重要信息。

在我们的例子中，开始项目只需要执行以下命令：

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## 角色创建

Now we will define the characters of this story. To do this, we will define in the `/values/characters.ts` file the characters that we will be using. For more information on how to create and use characters you can consult: <DynamicLink href="/start/character">Characters</DynamicLink>

What does `mc` mean? `mc` is a common abbreviation for "Main Character". It is a common practice in visual novels to use `mc` as the main character's name.

```ts tab="values/characters.ts"
import { RegisteredCharacters } from "@drincs/pixi-vn";
import Character from "../models/Character";

export const mc = new Character('mc', {
    name: 'Me',
});

export const james = new Character('james', {
    name: 'James',
    color: "#0084ac"
});

export const steph = new Character('steph', {
    name: 'Steph',
    color: "#ac5900"
});

export const sly = new Character('sly', {
    name: 'Sly',
    color: "#6d00ac"
});

RegisteredCharacters.add([mc, james, steph, sly]);
```

```ts tab="App.tsx"
// Remember to import the character file at least once into your project. // [!code focus]
import "./values/characters"; // [!code focus]

export default function App() {
return // ...
}
```

## First draft of the narrative

<Callout title="Markup" type="info">

All templates have  <DynamicLink href="/start/markup-markdown">Markdown</DynamicLink> and <DynamicLink href="/start/markup-tailwindcss">Tailwind CSS</DynamicLink> support, so we will use it for our narration.

</Callout>

Now we can start writing the "first draft" of the <DynamicLink href="/start/narration">narration</DynamicLink> of the visual novel.
We will create the first <DynamicLink href="/start/labels">`label`</DynamicLink> called `start`, which will be the beginning of the game. After that we can write the <DynamicLink href="/start/dialogue">dialogues</DynamicLink> that will follow in our visual novel.

This is the example:

```ink tab="ink" title="ink/start.ink" groupId="narrative_language"
=== start ===
james: You're my roommate's replacement, huh?
james: Don't worry, you don't have much to live up to. Just don't use heroin like the last guy, and you' fine!
mc: ...

He thrusts out his hand.

james: James!
mc: ...Peter.

I take his hand and shake.

james: Ooh, Peter! Nice, firm handshake! The last quy always gave me the dead fish. I already think we'r gonna get along fine.
james: Come on in and... 
james: ...
james: I know you're both watching, come on out already!

sly: I just wanted to see what the new guy was like. Hey, you, Peter- be nice to our little brother, or you'll have to deal with *us*.
mc: ...
james: Peter, this is Sly. Yes, that is her real name.

I put out my hand.

sly: I'm not shakin' your hand until I decide you're an all-right dude. Sorry, policy.
mc: Fair enough, I'm a pretty scary guy, or so l've been told.
james: The redhead behind her is Stephanie.
// Example of using Tailwind CSS
steph: <span class="inline-block motion-translate-y-loop-25">Hey</span>! Everyone calls me Steph. I'll shake your hand.

// ...
-> DONE
```

```ts tab="Typescript" title="labels/startLabel.ts" groupId="narrative_language"
const startLabel = newLabel("start", [
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `You're my roommate's replacement, huh?` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `Don't worry, you don't have much to live up to. Just don't use heroin like the last guy, and you' fine!` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: mc, text: `...` },
    () => { narration.dialogue = "He thrusts out his hand." },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `James!` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: mc, text: `...Peter.` },
    () => { narration.dialogue = "I take his hand and shake." },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `Ooh, Peter! Nice, firm handshake! The last quy always gave me the dead fish. I already think we'r gonna get along fine.` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `Come on in and...` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `...` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `I know you're both watching, come on out already!` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `I just wanted to see what the new guy was like. Hey, you, Peter- be nice to our little brother, or you'll have to deal with *us*.` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: mc, text: `...` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `Peter, this is Sly. Yes, that is her real name.` },
    () => { narration.dialogue = "I put out my hand." },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `I'm not shakin' your hand until I decide you're an all-right dude. Sorry, policy.` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: mc, text: `Fair enough, I'm a pretty scary guy, or so l've been told.` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `The redhead behind her is Stephanie.` },
    // Example of using Tailwind CSS
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: steph, text: `<span class="inline-block motion-translate-y-loop-25">Hey</span>! Everyone calls me Steph. I'll shake your hand.` },
    // ...
]);
export default startLabel;
```

### Split the narrative into labels

It is not advisable to create very long `labels` (even for linear visual novels), but it is advisable to create multiple small `labels` and "call" them when needed with the <DynamicLink href="/start/labels-flow">narration flow control features</DynamicLink>.

For this reason, even if in our case our story is linear, it will be divided into two `labels`, the first will be the one we just created, while the second will be called `second_part`.

This is the example:

```ink tab="ink" title="ink/start.ink" groupId="narrative_language"
=== start ===
james: You're my roommate's replacement, huh?
james: Don't worry, you don't have much to live up to. Just don't use heroin like the last guy, and you' fine!
mc: ...

He thrusts out his hand.

james: James!
mc: ...Peter.

// ...
-> second_part

=== second_part ===

She enters my room before I'VE even had a chance to. \\n\\n...I could've just come back and gotten the platter later...
She sets it on a desk. I throw my two paper bags down beside the empty bed.

steph: They got you a new mattress, right? That last guy was a druggie, did James tell you that?
sly: *We're* the reason he got expelled!
steph: Sly! If word gets out about that... well, actually, it wouldn't matter, *he's* the one who shot himself up.

I'm fumbling for a new subject.

// ...
-> DONE
```

```ts tab="Typescript" title="labels/startLabel.ts" groupId="narrative_language"
const startLabel = newLabel("start", [
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `You're my roommate's replacement, huh?` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `Don't worry, you don't have much to live up to. Just don't use heroin like the last guy, and you' fine!` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: mc, text: `...` },
    () => { narration.dialogue = "He thrusts out his hand." },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `James!` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: mc, text: `...Peter.` },
    // ...
    async (props) => await narration.jumpLabel(secondPart, props),
]);
export default startLabel;

const secondPart = newLabel("second_part", [
    () => { narration.dialogue = `She enters my room before I'VE even had a chance to. \n\n...I could've just come back and gotten the platter later...` },
    () => { narration.dialogue = `She sets it on a desk. I throw my two paper bags down beside the empty bed.` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: steph, text: `They got you a new mattress, right? That last guy was a druggie, did James tell you that?` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: sly, text: `*We're* the reason he got expelled!` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: steph, text: `Sly! If word gets out about that... well, actually, it wouldn't matter, *he's* the one who shot himself up.` },
    () => { narration.dialogue = `I'm fumbling for a new subject.` },
    // ...
]);
```

## Choice menus

Now we will ask the player if he wants to continue with the second part of the visual novel.

To do this, we will use the <DynamicLink href="/start/choices">choice menu</DynamicLink>.

This is the example:

```ink tab="ink" title="ink/start.ink" groupId="narrative_language"
=== start ===
// ...

You want continue to the next part?
* Yes, I want to continue
-> second_part
* No, I want to stop here
-> END

=== second_part ===

// ...
-> DONE
```

```ts tab="Typescript" title="labels/startLabel.ts" groupId="narrative_language"
const startLabel = newLabel("start", [
    // ...
    async () => {
        narration.dialogue = `You want continue to the next part?`
        narration.choiceMenuOptions = [
            newChoiceOption("Yes, I want to continue", secondPart, {}, { type: "jump" }),
            newCloseChoiceOption("No, I want to stop here"),
        ]
    },
]);
export default startLabel;

const secondPart = newLabel("second_part", [
    // ...
]);
```

## Edit character information and use it as a variable

Now I will give the player the ability to change the name of the `mc`.

To do this, I will ask the player to <DynamicLink href="/start/input">complete an input box using Pixi’VN's features</DynamicLink>.

After getting the input value, you can <DynamicLink href="/start/character#edit">set the character name</DynamicLink> using the obtained value.

This is the example:

```ink tab="ink" title="ink/start.ink" groupId="narrative_language"
VAR _input_value_ = ""

=== start ===
// ...

He thrusts out his hand.
# request input type string default Peter
What is your name?
# rename mc { _input_value_ }

// ...
-> DONE
```

```ts tab="Typescript" title="labels/startLabel.ts" groupId="narrative_language"
const startLabel = newLabel("start", [
    // ...
    () => { narration.dialogue = `He thrusts out his hand.` },
    () => {
        narration.requestInput({ type: "string" }, "Peter")
        narration.dialogue = `What is your name?`
    },
    () => {
        mc.name = narration.inputValue as string
    },
    // ...
]);
export default startLabel;
```

Now we could <DynamicLink href="/start/character#use">use character names</DynamicLink> within dialogues.

This is the example:

```ink tab="ink" title="ink/start.ink" groupId="narrative_language"
VAR steph_fullname = "Stephanie"

=== start ===
// ...

sly: I just wanted to see what the new guy was like. Hey, you, [mc]- be nice to our little brother, or you'll have to deal with *us*.
mc: ...
james: [mc], this is [sly]. Yes, that is her real name.

I put out my hand.

sly: I'm not shakin' your hand until I decide you're an all-right dude. Sorry, policy.
mc: Fair enough, I'm a pretty scary guy, or so l've been told.
james: The redhead behind her is [steph_fullname].
steph: Hey! Everyone calls me [steph]. I'll shake your hand.

She puts out her hand, and I take it.

mc: Thanks, good to meet you, [steph_fullname].
steph: WOW, that is, like, the most perfect handshake I've ever had! Firm, but also gentle. [sly], you *gotta* shake his hand!

// ...
-> DONE
```

```ts tab="Typescript" title="labels/startLabel.ts" groupId="narrative_language"
const steph_fullname = "Stephanie";

const startLabel = newLabel("start", [
    // ...
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: sly, text: `I just wanted to see what the new guy was like. Hey, you, ${mc.name}- be nice to our little brother, or you'll have to deal with *us*.` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: mc, text: `...` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `${mc.name}, this is ${sly.name}. Yes, that is her real name.` },
    () => { narration.dialogue = `I put out my hand.` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: sly, text: `I'm not shakin' your hand until I decide you're an all-right dude. Sorry, policy.` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: mc, text: `Fair enough, I'm a pretty scary guy, or so I've been told.` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `The redhead behind her is ${steph_fullname}.` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: steph, text: `Hey! Everyone calls me ${steph.name}. I'll shake your hand.` },
    () => { narration.dialogue = `She puts out her hand, and I take it.` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: mc, text: `Thanks, good to meet you, ${steph_fullname}.` },
    () => narration.dialogue = { character: steph, text: `WOW, that is, like, the most perfect handshake I've ever had! Firm, but also gentle. ${sly.name}, you *gotta* shake his hand!` },
    // ...
]);
export default startLabel;
```

## Use the "glue" feature of dialogues

In visual novels, it is often useful to paste text into the current dialogue. For example, to pause a conversation and have it continue in a subsequent `step`. To do this, we can use the <DynamicLink href="/start/dialogue#dialogue-glue">glue functionality</DynamicLink>.

This is the example:

```ink tab="ink" title="ink/start.ink" groupId="narrative_language"
=== start ===
// ...

james: Ooh, [mc]! Nice, firm handshake!
<>The last guy always gave me the dead fish.
<>I already think we're gonna get along fine.
james: Come on in and...

// ...
-> DONE
```

```ts tab="Typescript" title="labels/startLabel.ts" groupId="narrative_language"
const startLabel = newLabel("start", [
    // ...
    async () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `Ooh, ${mc.name}! Nice, firm handshake!` },
    async () => {
        narration.dialogGlue = true
        narration.dialogue = `The last guy always gave me the dead fish.`
    },
    async () => {
        narration.dialogGlue = true
        narration.dialogue = `I already think we're gonna get along fine.`
    },
    async () => narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `Come on in and...` },
    // ...
]);
export default startLabel;
```

## Define assets and load them

<Callout type="info">

To load and manipulate assets (images, gifs, videos...) you will need to use `Assets`. `Assets` is a class with many features and comes from the PixiJS library, if you want more information read [here](https://pixijs.com/8.x/guides/components/assets).

</Callout>

One of the first `steps` is choosing where to save your visual novel assets. In this case, we will save the assets in the Firebase storage (a hosting service). You can use any hosting service you prefer or even save the assets locally in the project, read more about it <DynamicLink href="/start/assets">here</DynamicLink>.

Before using an asset it is highly recommended to <DynamicLink href="/start/assets-management#initialize-the-asset-matrix-at-project-start">initialize the asset matrix</DynamicLink>.

By default, as you can see in the `assets/manifest.ts` file, all templates in the `onLoadingLabel` try to load in the background the "bundle assets" with the alias equal to the current `label` id. So it is recommended to add, in the `manifest`, a "bundle assets" for each `label` with the alias equal to the `label` id and containing the images used in that `label`.

This is the example:

```ts tab="assets/manifest.ts"
import { AssetsManifest } from "@drincs/pixi-vn";
import { MAIN_MENU_ROUTE } from "../constans";

/**
 * Manifest for the assets used in the game.
 * You can read more about the manifest here: https://pixijs.com/8.x/guides/components/assets#loading-multiple-assets
 */
const manifest: AssetsManifest = {
    bundles: [
        // screens
        {
            name: MAIN_MENU_ROUTE,
            assets: [
                {
                    alias: "background_main_menu",
                    src: "https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pixi-vn.appspot.com/o/public%2Fmain-menu.webp?alt=media",
                },
            ],
        },
        // labels
        {
            name: "start",
            assets: [
                {
                    alias: "bg01-hallway",
                    src: "https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pixi-vn.appspot.com/o/public%2Fbreakdown%2Fbg01-hallway.webp?alt=media",
                },
            ],
        },
        {
            name: "second_part",
            assets: [
                {
                    alias: "bg02-dorm",
                    src: "https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pixi-vn.appspot.com/o/public%2Fbreakdown%2Fbg02-dorm.webp?alt=media",
                },
            ],
        },
        // characters
        {
            name: "fm01",
            assets: [
                {
                    alias: "fm01-body",
                    src: "https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pixi-vn.appspot.com/o/public%2Fbreakdown%2Ffm01%2Ffm01-body.webp?alt=media",
                },

export async function defineAssets() {
    Assets.init({ manifest });

    // The game will not start until these asserts are loaded.
    await Assets.loadBundle("main_menu");

    // The game will start immediately, but these asserts will be loaded in the background.
    // Assets.backgroundLoadBundle("main_menu");
    // Assets.backgroundLoad("background_main_menu");
}
```

```ts tab="src/main.ts"
import { Assets, canvas, Container, Game } from "@drincs/pixi-vn";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";
import { CANVAS_UI_LAYER_NAME } from "./constans";
import "./index.css";

// ...

Game.onLoadingLabel((_stepId, { id }) => { // [!code focus]
    Assets.backgroundLoadBundle(id); // [!code focus]
}); // [!code focus]
```

## Add background and character images

Now it's time to think about the visual part too. We will add the background and character sprites to the visual novel canvas.

**What is a sprite?** In computer graphics, a sprite is a two-dimensional bitmap that is integrated into a larger scene, most often in a 2D video game.

In our case the character sprites are composed of 3 images: the body, the eyes and the mouth. Then we use <DynamicLink href="/start/canvas-image-container">ImageContainer</DynamicLink> to compose the character. You can find more information on how to add canvas components in <DynamicLink href="/start/canvas-components">this documentation</DynamicLink>.

This is the example:

```ink tab="ink" title="ink/start.ink" groupId="narrative_language"
=== start ===
# show image bg bg01-hallway
# show imagecontainer james [m01-body m01-eyes-smile m01-mouth-neutral01] xAlign 0.5 yAlign 1
james: You're my roommate's replacement, huh?
# show imagecontainer james [m01-body m01-eyes-grin m01-mouth-smile01]
james: Don't worry, you don't have much to live up to. Just don't use heroin like the last guy, and you'll be fine!
# show imagecontainer james [m01-body m01-eyes-smile m01-mouth-grin00]
mc: ...

// ...
-> DONE
```

```ts tab="Typescript" title="labels/startLabel.ts" groupId="narrative_language"
const startLabel = newLabel("start", [
    async () => {
        await showImage("bg", "bg01-hallway");
        await showImageContainer("james", ["m01-body", "m01-eyes-smile", "m01-mouth-neutral01"], { xAlign: 0.5, yAlign: 1 });
        narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `You're my roommate's replacement, huh?` }
    },
    async () => {
        await showImageContainer("james", ["m01-body", "m01-eyes-grin", "m01-mouth-smile01"])
        narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `Don't worry, you don't have much to live up to. Just don't use heroin like the last guy, and you'll be fine!` }
    },
    async () => {
        await showImageContainer("james", ["m01-body", "m01-eyes-smile", "m01-mouth-grin00"])
        narration.dialogue = { character: mc, text: `...` }
    },
    // ...
]);
export default startLabel;
```

## Smart asset loading

In our case we saved the game images on a hosting service (Firebase). For this reason the asset loading is not timely.

In order for the player not to perceive too many loadings we should group them in certain phases of the game. In my case I will load the most used images at the start of the `label`.

You can find more information on how to manage the loadings <DynamicLink href="/start/assets-management">here</DynamicLink>.

This is the example:

```ink tab="ink" title="ink/start.ink" groupId="narrative_language"
=== start ===
# lazyload bundle m01 fm01 fm02 // [!code focus]

# show image bg bg01-hallway
# show imagecontainer james [m01-body m01-eyes-smile m01-mouth-neutral01] xAlign 0.5 yAlign 1 with movein direction right speed 300
james: You're my roommate's replacement, huh?
# show imagecontainer james [m01-body m01-eyes-grin m01-mouth-smile01]
james: Don't worry, you don't have much to live up to. Just don't use heroin like the last guy, and you'll be fine!
# show imagecontainer james [m01-body m01-eyes-smile m01-mouth-grin00]
mc: ...

// ...
-> DONE
```

```ts tab="Typescript" title="labels/startLabel.ts" groupId="narrative_language"
const startLabel = newLabel("start", [
    // ...
], {
    onLoadingLabel: () => { // [!code focus]
        Assets.backgroundLoadBundle(["fm01", "fm02", "m01"]); // [!code focus]
    } // [!code focus]
});
export default startLabel;
```

## Use transitions

To make the visual novel more dynamic, you can use transitions to show images. You can find more information about using transitions <DynamicLink href="/start/canvas-transition">here</DynamicLink>.

This is the example:

```ink tab="ink" title="ink/start.ink" groupId="narrative_language"
=== start ===
// ...

# show image bg bg01-hallway
# show imagecontainer james [m01-body m01-eyes-smile m01-mouth-neutral01] xAlign 0.5 yAlign 1 with movein direction right speed 300
james: You're my roommate's replacement, huh?
# show imagecontainer james [m01-body m01-eyes-grin m01-mouth-smile01]
james: Don't worry, you don't have much to live up to. Just don't use heroin like the last guy, and you'll be fine!
# show imagecontainer james [m01-body m01-eyes-smile m01-mouth-grin00]
mc: ...

// ...
-> DONE
```

```ts tab="Typescript" title="labels/startLabel.ts" groupId="narrative_language"
const startLabel = newLabel("start", [
    async () => {
        await showImage("bg", "bg01-hallway");
        await moveIn(
            "james",
            {
                value: ["m01-body", "m01-eyes-smile", "m01-mouth-neutral01"],
                options: { xAlign: 0.5, yAlign: 1 },
            },
            { direction: "right", ease: "circInOut", type: "spring" }
        );
        narration.dialogue = { character: james, text: `You're my roommate's replacement, huh?` };
    },
    async () => {
        await showImageContainer("james", ["m01-body", "m01-eyes-grin", "m01-mouth-smile01"]);
        narration.dialogue = {
            character: james,
            text: `Don't worry, you don't have much to live up to. Just don't use heroin like the last guy, and you'll be fine!`,
        };
    },
    async () => {
        await showImageContainer("james", ["m01-body", "m01-eyes-smile", "m01-mouth-grin00"]);
        narration.dialogue = { character: mc, text: `...` };
    },
    // ...
]);
export default startLabel;
```

## Building an animation

To make the visual novel more dynamic, you can use animations. For more information about how to use animations, see <DynamicLink href="/start/canvas-animations-effects">here</DynamicLink>.

I recommend using TypeScript if you need to set many properties, as this gives you more control, more functionality, and type feedback.

In this example, my animation will take `steph` out of the scene and reinsert her in the next `step`. I'll also mirror her on the x-axis to make sure she's facing the right way.

To take `steph` out/in, I will use the `moveOut` and `moveIn` functions. For the mirror effect, I will use the `canvas.animate` function.

First, I use the `canvas.animate` function to create an animation that sets the `scaleX` property from `-1` (mirrored) to `1`, with `autoplay: false` so it does not start immediately.

Then, I use the `moveIn` function to move `steph` into the scene, passing the `tickerId` of the animation so it can be resumed after the transition is complete.

I use the `forceCompleteBeforeNext: true` option to ensure the animation completes before the next `step` is executed. For `moveIn`, being a transition, `forceCompleteBeforeNext` is true by default.

Since I use TypeScript for this animation, I created a `label` for it, so it can be called from other languages as well.

```ts title="labels/animation01.ts"
import { canvas, ImageContainer, moveIn, newLabel } from "@drincs/pixi-vn";

export const animation01 = newLabel("animation_01", [
    async () => {
        let tickerId = canvas.animate<ImageContainer>(
            "steph",
            {
                scaleX: 1,
            },
            { autoplay: false, forceCompleteBeforeNext: true }
        );

        await moveIn(
            "steph",
            {
                value: ["fm02-body", "fm02-eyes-joy", "fm02-mouth-smile01"],
                options: { xAlign: 0.8, yAlign: 1, scale: { y: 1, x: -1 }, anchor: 0.5 },
            },
            { direction: "right", ease: "easeInOut", tickerIdToResume: tickerId }
        );
    },
]);
```

Now you can call this `label` (`animation_01`) from the main `label` (`start`). (As explained <DynamicLink href="/ink/ink-label#use-the-call-script">here</DynamicLink>, from _ink_ you can call `labels` written in ts and vice versa.)

```ink tab="ink" title="ink/start.ink" groupId="narrative_language"
=== start ===
// ...

# show imagecontainer james [m01-body m01-eyes-grin m01-mouth-grin00]
# show imagecontainer sly [fm01-body fm01-eyes-smile fm01-mouth-smile00]
# show imagecontainer steph [fm02-body fm02-eyes-upset fm02-mouth-nervous00]
# remove image steph with moveout direction left speed 300
[steph_fullname] goes through the opposite door,
# call animation_01
<> and returns with a HUGE tinfoil-covered platter.

// ...
-> DONE
```

```ts tab="Typescript" title="labels/startLabel.ts" groupId="narrative_language"
const startLabel = newLabel("start", [
    // ...
    async () => {
        await showImageContainer("james", ["m01-body", "m01-eyes-grin", "m01-mouth-grin00"]);
        await showImageContainer("sly", ["fm01-body", "fm01-eyes-smile", "fm01-mouth-smile00"]);
        await showImageContainer("steph", ["fm02-body", "fm02-eyes-upset", "fm02-mouth-nervous00"]);
        moveOut("steph", { direction: "left", speed: 300 });
        narration.dialogue = `${steph_fullname} goes through the opposite door,`;
    },
    async (props) => {
        narration.dialogGlue = true;
        narration.dialogue = ` and returns with a HUGE tinfoil-covered platter.`;
        await narration.callLabel(animation01, props);
    },
    // ...
]);
export default startLabel;
```
