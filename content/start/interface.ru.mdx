title: User Interface (UI) with JavaScript Framework

import { Accordion, Accordions } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/accordion';

**What is UI?** UI stands for User Interface. It refers to the visual elements and interactive components through which a user interacts with a digital device, application, or website. The UI includes everything that users interact with, such as buttons, menus, icons, text fields, and layout. The goal of UI design is to create an interface that is both aesthetically pleasing and functional, providing a seamless and intuitive experience for users.

Pixi’VN does not offer any components to create the game UI. As it is designed, the UI must be created using external JavaScript Frameworks. This allows the use of systems such as React, Vue, etc. to create much more complex **UI screens** with excellent performance.

- <DynamicLink href="/start/interface-vue">Vue</DynamicLink>

Pixi’VN offers some features to improve its compatibility with other JavaScript Frameworks:

- possibility of adding an HTML Element with the same dimensions as the <DynamicLink href="/start/canvas-components">PixiJS Canvas</DynamicLink> to add an **UI** with a JavaScript frameworks.

**What is an HTML UI Layer?** An HTML UI Layer is an HTML element that is added above the PixiJS canvas and has the same dimensions as the canvas. This allows you to create a UI with a JavaScript framework such as React or Vue.

To add an HTML UI Layer, you can use the `canvas.addHtmlLayer` method. This method takes the following parameters:

- `id`: the id of the layer, it must be unique.
- `element`: the HTML element to add as a layer.
- `style`: an object with the style properties to apply to the layer. The default style is `{ position: "absolute", pointerEvents: "none" }`.

For example:

```ts
const root = document.getElementById("root");
if (!root) {
    throw new Error("root element not found");
}
const htmlLayer = canvas.addHtmlLayer("ui", root, {
    position: "absolute",
    pointerEvents: "none"
});
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="" id="how-to-enable-ui-interaction">

By default, all HTML elements of the UI have the `pointer-events: none` style.
The reason is that because the html UI is above the canvas, all clicks are intercepted by the UI and not by the canvas.

So you must set the `pointer-events: auto` style only for the elements (example a button, a form, etc...) that you want to interact with the user.

## Differences between the UI and the canvas

As Pixi’VN was designed and conceived, the UI and the canvas are two distinct and independent elements. The UI is above the canvas and is used to create buttons, forms, etc. The canvas is used to display images, videos, etc.

All information about the current state of the canvas is included in the save and it is possible to restore the state of a previous step. The current state of the UI will not be included in the saves. So you have to <DynamicLink href="/start/interface-connect-storage">manage it yourself by saving the information</DynamicLink> you need to <DynamicLink href="/start/storage">game storage</DynamicLink> or browser storage.

In the canvas you can add components during each step. In the UI you can't do that, you can create several <DynamicLink href="/start/interface-connect-storage">"screens" and navigate between them</DynamicLink>.

In the canvas you can only add PixiJS components, they are usually composed of images and are very simple. In the UI you can add any HTML element or use any UI component library, so you can create much more complex interfaces.
