description: How to store, retrieve, and manage persistent and temporary variables in Pixi’VN, including Keyv integration.
---

**What is the game storage?** The game storage is a place where you can save variables that you want to keep between game sessions.

It is essential to understand that if variables are not saved in the game memory, the engine will not be able to handle them when you <DynamicLink href="/start/save#load">load a save</DynamicLink> or when you <DynamicLink href="/start/labels-flow#go-back">go back</DynamicLink>.

Additionally, in the game archive you can save any type of variable, except `class` and `function` (because they cannot be converted to JSON), such as: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `object`, `array`, etc. If you want to save "flags" (boolean), it is recommended to use the <DynamicLink href="/start/flags">flags functionality</DynamicLink>, a very high-performance flag management system.

## Set

To set a variable in the game storage, use `storage.set`. This function has the following parameters:

* `name`: The name of the variable to set.
* `value`: The value of the variable to set.

```typescript
import { storage } from '@drincs/pixi-vn'

storage.set("myVariable", 42);
```

## Get

To get a variable from the game storage, use `storage.get`. This function has the following parameters:

* `name`: The name of the variable to get.

```typescript
import { storage } from '@drincs/pixi-vn'

const myVariable = storage.get("myVariable");
```

## Remove

To remove a variable from the game storage, use `storage.remove`. This function has the following parameters:

* `name`: The name of the variable to remove.

```typescript
import { storage } from '@drincs/pixi-vn'

storage.remove("myVariable");
```

<Accordions>

<Accordion title="System variables" id="system-variables">

In game storage, there are some system variables that are used by the game engine. All system variables start with the prefix `___`.
So please avoid using this prefix in your variables.

You can get all system variable keys from the `SYSTEM_RESERVED_STORAGE_KEYS` constant.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Keyv" id="keyv">

The entire storage system was developed using `Map`, a native JavaScript object, so you can use Keyv to interact with game storage.

**What is Keyv?** Keyv is a simple key-value storage. It is a very easy-to-use system and very popular in the Node.js community. Keyv can be combined with other libraries, such as [Cacheable](https://cacheable.org/) (Caching for Node.js based on Keyv). You can learn more on the [Keyv website](https://keyv.org/).

**How to use Keyv with Pixi’VN?** You can use Keyv with Pixi’VN by creating a new instance of Keyv and passing the storage object as a parameter.

```typescript
import { storage } from '@drincs/pixi-vn'
import Keyv from 'keyv';

const keyvStorage = new Keyv({ store: storage.storage });

keyvStorage.get<string>("myValue").then((value) => {
    console.log(value);
});
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Default storage variables" id="default-storage-variables">

It's possible to set the default storage variables when the game starts.

These variables will have the following characteristics:

* They will not be initialized when the game starts.
* If they are removed or set to undefined or null, the value will automatically be set to the default value (so they can never be undefined or null).
* Default values ​​will not be saved in saves, so you can change them from one version to another without any problems.

You can set the default storage variables using the `storage.default` object.

```typescript
import { storage } from '@drincs/pixi-vn'

storage.default = {
    myVariable: 42,
    anotherVariable: "Hello, world!"
};
```
