A markup language is a text-encoding system that specifies the structure, formatting, and relationships within a document. Markup can control how a document is displayed or enrich its content for automated processing. Common markup languages include HTML, KML/KMZ, XML, Markdown, and others.

For Pixi’VN, it is recommended to use <DynamicLink href="/start/markup-markdown">**Markdown**</DynamicLink> due to its simplicity and popularity. Markdown can often be combined with HTML, allowing you to use CSS for custom text styling. For advanced styling, consider using a CSS framework like <DynamicLink href="/start/markup-tailwindcss">**Tailwind CSS**</DynamicLink>.
