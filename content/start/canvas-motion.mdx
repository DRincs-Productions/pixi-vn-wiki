title: Animate (motion)
---

Pixi’VN gives the developer the ability to animate canvas components using a function called `animate`. This function is nothing more than a re-implementation of the [animate function from the motion library](https://motion.dev/docs/animate). This re-implementation uses PixiJS tickers to trigger animation events.

**What is motion?** `motion` is a library that provides a simple, powerful and popular way to create animations in JavaScript. You can read more about it [here](https://motion.dev/).

There are two variants of this function:

* `animate`: This function is intended for animating PixiJS or Pixi’VN elements used for <DynamicLink href="/start/interface-pixijs">UI</DynamicLink>. Pixi’VN will not save the current state of animations created with this function. Since it is identical to [motion’s animate function](https://motion.dev/docs/animate), it will not be explained further.
* `canvas.animate`: This function is intended for animating Pixi’VN canvas components. It will save the current state of animations created with this function, so you can use it to create transitions between different states of your game. This feature has some differences from the original `animate` function, so it will be explained in detail.

## Functions
