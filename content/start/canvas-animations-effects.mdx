description: Animations and effects for canvas components in Pixi’VN, including definitions and categories.

Pixi’VN provides a set of animations and effects that can be applied to canvas components.

**What is an animation?** An animation is a process that moves a canvas component without altering its texture. For example, a process that moves a canvas component from `(0, 0)` to `(100, 100)`.

**What is an effect?** An effect is a process that alters the texture of a canvas component. For example, a process that fades a canvas component.

Animations and effects are divided into two categories:
