---

Pixiâ€™VN provides a set of animations and effects that can be applied to canvas components.

**What is a animation?** An animation is a process that moves a canvas component without altering the texture. For example, a process that move a canvas component from `(0, 0)` to `(100, 100)`.

**What is a effect?** An effect is a process that alters the texture of a canvas component. For example, a process that fade a canvas component.

Animations and effects are divided into two categories:

* [Primitives (ticker)](/start/canvas-tickers.md)
* [Articulated](/start/canvas-articulated-animations-effects.md)
