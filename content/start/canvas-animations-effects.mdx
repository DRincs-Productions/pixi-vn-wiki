title: Animations and transitions
---

Pixiâ€™VN provides functionality to easily animate components. The core animation function is <DynamicLink href="/start/canvas-motion">`animate`</DynamicLink>, which wraps the popular [`motion`](https://motion.dev/) library. While `motion` handles the mathematical calculations for the animation, the actual updates are triggered by <DynamicLink href="/start/canvas-tickers">Tickers</DynamicLink>.

You also have several functions to perform <DynamicLink href="/start/canvas-transition">transitions</DynamicLink> between steps. All transitions are built on top of the `animate` function, so you can easily create custom transitions as well.
