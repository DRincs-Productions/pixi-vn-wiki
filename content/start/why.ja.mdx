description: Overview of Pixi’VN's purpose, features, and advantages as a modern, flexible 2D game engine.
---

The reason why Pixi’VN was born is that the current systems for creating visual novels or 2D RPGs are based on old systems and have many shortcomings.

Pixi’VN combines the development of various 2D games in a single engine, bringing video game development closer to web applications in order to take advantage of their great compatibility and cloud services.

## What is Pixi’VN?

Pixi’VN is a versatile and powerful 2D game engine based on JavaScript/TypeScript and [PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/).

It provides the following features:

- Narrative management
- 2D rendering
- Functionality to play sounds and music
- Storage to set and get game variables
- Saves the current state of the entire game at each `step`, giving the possibility to go back
- Functionality to save and load the current state of the game

For a quick start, various <DynamicLink href="/start#project-initialization">project templates</DynamicLink> are available. Less experienced developers can use these templates without much knowledge of JavaScript/TypeScript.

You have the option to use various types of narrative languages (in addition to JavaScript/TypeScript). Currently you can use the following:

- <DynamicLink href="/ink">*ink*</DynamicLink>
- <DynamicLink href="/renpy">Ren'Py</DynamicLink>

## Features of Pixi’VN

Its great **versatility** is due to the fact that Pixi’VN is an npm package, not a framework. This means it can be installed in any JavaScript project and integrated with your favorite JavaScript framework (React, Vue, etc.).
You may use the provided functionality for a variety of purposes, from creating a visual novel or other type of 2D game (such as point-and-click adventure, RPGs, etc.), using only the narrative features in a 3D game, displaying an animation on a website, and more.

To be as **lightweight** as possible, it only deals with specific features, allowing and encouraging you to add more with other libraries. There is no need to use heavy IDEs for development; any code editor will do.

It does **not reinvent things** that already exist. Pixi’VN binds together several very popular libraries and provides APIs to interact with them and have full access. It does not invent new programming or narrative languages.
