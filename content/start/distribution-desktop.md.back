# Desktop devices

There are many ways to distribute your game on desktop devices. You can use [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), [NW.js](https://nwjs.io/), or [React Native for Windows + Mac](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/).

However, if you do not want to create a project with large customizations, I recommend using the [multi-device templates](/start#project-initialization), in which Electron Forge has been added in order to allow both the development of a Web app and the development of desktop and mobile applications, and the readme explains how to distribute the game on multiple devices.
