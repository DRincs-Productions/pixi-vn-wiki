A very important point to take into account before developing a game is the distribution of the game. It is important to know how the game will be distributed and how it will be played by the users.

Potentially all JavaScript/Typescript projects can be distributed in **all platforms**. For example, Discord is a JavaScript/Typescript project that have a desktop app, a web app and a mobile app.
