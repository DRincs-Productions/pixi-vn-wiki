title: Temporary storage
description: Explains how to use temporary storage in Pixi'VN for variables that are only needed during a specific narrative period.
---

In many cases, it is useful to use variables only during a certain period of the narrative. Using normal storage, you would need to manually remove these variables when they are no longer needed, to keep saves light and efficient.

To solve this problem, Pixi’VN has a temporary storage system. Temporary variables initialized in a `label` will be deleted when the `label` is closed. If another `label` is called from it, the temporary variable will still be accessible from the child `label`. However, if another `label` is called with `jump` (so the current `label` will be closed and the new one started), the temporary variable will no longer be accessible.

## Set

To set a temporary variable, use `storage.setTempVariable`. Esta función tiene los siguientes parámetros:

- `name`: The name of the variable to set.
- `value`: The value of the variable to set.

```typescript
import { storage } from '@drincs/pixi-vn'

storage.setTempVariable("myTempVariable", 42);
```

## Get

To get a temporary variable, use the normal <DynamicLink href="/start/storage#set">`storage.get` function</DynamicLink>.

## Remove

To remove a temporary variable, use `storage.removeTempVariable`. Esta función tiene los siguientes parámetros:

- `name`: The name of the variable to remove.

```typescript
import { storage } from '@drincs/pixi-vn'

storage.removeTempVariable("myTempVariable");
```
