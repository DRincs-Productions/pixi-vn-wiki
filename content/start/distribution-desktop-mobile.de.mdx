description: Learn how to distribute your game for desktop and mobile platforms using Tauri and GitHub Actions.
---

There are several ways to distribute your game for desktop and mobile platforms. Common choices include [Tauri](https://v2.tauri.app/), [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/), [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), [NW.js](https://nwjs.io/), and [React Native for Windows + Mac](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/).

If you don't want to manage a heavily customized native project, consider using the <DynamicLink href="/start#project-initialization">multi-device templates</DynamicLink>. Those templates include Tauri so you can develop a web app and also build desktop and mobile apps from the same codebase.

## Tauri

Tauri is a framework for building desktop and mobile applications with web technologies. It leverages **Rust** to produce secure, lightweight, and fast native binaries, while a WebView renders your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Learn more on the [Tauri website](https://v2.tauri.app/).

## Distributing your game with Tauri

Creating releases manually for every platform is difficult: it requires many tools to be installed, and building iOS apps requires a Mac. For these reasons, manual release generation is generally not recommended.

Tauri supports using GitHub Actions to automate release builds. GitHub Actions runs jobs on virtual machines (runners) that you configure with YAML workflow files. In a workflow you define the events that trigger the pipeline (for example, pushing a tag) and the list of commands the runner should execute.

Currently, mobile builds via GitHub Actions are experimental.

The <DynamicLink href="/start#project-initialization">multi-device templates</DynamicLink> include the file `/.github/workflows/tauri.yml`. That workflow builds release artifacts (installation packages) for multiple operating systems.

        with:
          tagName: app-v__VERSION__ # the action automatically replaces \_\_VERSION\_\_ with the app version.
          releaseName: 'App v__VERSION__'
          releaseBody: 'See the assets to download this version and install.'
          releaseDraft: true
          prerelease: false
          args: ${{ matrix.args }}
          mobile: ${{ matrix.mobile || null }}
```

To trigger this workflow you need a GitHub repository for your project and a Git tag that starts with `v`. For example:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

You can follow the workflow runs in the repository's Actions tab.

At the end of a successful run a GitHub Release will be created. Read more about GitHub Releases [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/viewing-your-repositorys-releases-and-tags).
