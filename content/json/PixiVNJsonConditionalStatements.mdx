Depending on the `type`, it can respond to the following models.

* If is `ifelse` it responds to the [`PixiVNJsonIfElse`](#pixivnjsonifelse-model) model.
* If is `stepswitch` it responds to the [`PixiVNJsonStepSwitch`](#pixivnjsonstepswitch-model) model.

## PixiVNJsonIfElse Model

The `PixiVNJsonIfElse<Then>` is used to define an if-else statement. It contains the following properties:

* `condition`: PixiVNJsonConditions;
* `then`: `Then` | `PixiVNJsonIfElse<Then>`;
* `else` (Optional): `Then` | `PixiVNJsonIfElse<Then>`;

## PixiVNJsonStepSwitch Model

* `choiceType`: "random" "sequential" "loop" "sequentialrandom"
* `elements`: `PixiVNJsonStepSwitchElementsType<Then>`;
