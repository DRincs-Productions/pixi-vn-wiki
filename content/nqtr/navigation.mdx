title: Navigation and Map
---

<Callout title="Nomenclature" type="info">
Usually in video games the navigation elements used to identify the position of the characters are the room, the location (for example restaurant, house, hospital etc...), the map. For this reason it was decided to keep names that follow this logic.

This does not prevent using these elements to manage navigation with the same logic but with different terms. For example in a game set in the space in which the player moves between planets, the rooms can be the planets, the locations can be the solar systems and the maps can be the galaxy.

The navigation system is composed of the following elements:

* rooms: These are the core elements of navigation, from which the position of the mc and npc is deduced.
* locations: is a container of rooms.
* maps: is a container of locations.

The player can move between rooms. The location and the map are also determined based on the room in which the player is located.

The developer can designate "index" rooms for places or maps, to implement features that allow moving from one location or map to another.
