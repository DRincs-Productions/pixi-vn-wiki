title: Time system
---

<Callout title="Nomenclature" type="info">
It was decided to use the very generic terms date and time. The reason is that, depending on what is being developed, time can correspond to hours, minutes, or a long period of time. The same applies to date.
</Callout>

The navigation system is composed of the following elements:

* date: A counter used to determine the date of the game.
* time: A counter is used to determine the time of day and which is reset every time date is incremented.

You can use `timeTracker` instance to manage your time system. It provides methods to initialize, get, increment time, etc. The time system is designed to be flexible and can be adapted to various game requirements.

## Initialize

To initialize the time system, you need use the `initialize` method of the `timeTracker` instance. This function has the following parameters:

TODO: ...

```ts name="main.ts"
timeTracker.initialize({
    defaultTimeSpent: 1,
    dayStartTime: 0,
    dayEndTime: 24,
    timeSlots: [
        { name: timeSlots.morning.description, startTime: timeSlots.morning.value },
        { name: timeSlots.afternoon.description, startTime: timeSlots.afternoon.value },
        { name: timeSlots.evening.description, startTime: timeSlots.evening.value },
        { name: timeSlots.night.description, startTime: timeSlots.night.value },
    ],
    getDayName: (weekDayNumber: number) => {
        const weekDaysNames = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"];
        return weekDaysNames[weekDayNumber];
    },
    weekendStartDay: 6,
    weekLength: 7,
});
```
