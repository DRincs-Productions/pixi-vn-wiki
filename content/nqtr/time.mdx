title: Time system
---

<Callout title="Nomenclature" type="info">
The time system is based on two numeric variables: date and time. Both of these variables have very generic names to give the developer freedom to use them as they wish.

The **date** is a counter that equals the number of days, or another time period chosen by the user, that have passed since the start of the game.

The **time** is also a counter that resets every day. The developer can also choose the time measurement, for example, whether to use hours or minutes.
