The quest system is a way to create and manage quests in your game. Quests can have multiple stages, and players can complete them to earn rewards or progress in the story.

## Initialize

To initialize a `quest`, create a new instance of the `QuestBaseModel` class (or your [custom class](#custom-class)) and add it to the game quest dictionary when the game is initialized.

<Callout type="info">

It is recommended to import the instances at project startup, see the `src/main.ts` file.

</Callout>

To create a new instance of `QuestBaseModel`, you need the following parameters:

```ts tab="values/aliceQuest.ts"
import { QuestBaseModel, RegisteredQuests, StageBaseModel } from "@drincs/nqtr";
import { orderProduct, takeProduct } from "../quests";
import { mcRoom, terrace } from "../rooms";

export const aliceQuest = new QuestBaseModel(
    "aliceQuest",
    [
        // stages
        new StageBaseModel("talk_alice1", {
            name: "Talk to Alice",
            description: "Talk to Alice on the terrace",
        }),
        new StageBaseModel("order_products", {
            onStart: () => {
                mcRoom.addActivity(orderProduct);
            },
            name: "Order products",
            description: "Order the products with your PC",
        }),
        new StageBaseModel("take_products", {
            onStart: (_, { notify }) => {
                terrace.addActivity(takeProduct);
                notify("You can take the products on the Terrace");
            },
            name: "Take products",
            description: "Take products on the Terrace",
            requestDescriptionToStart: "Wait for the products you ordered to arrive (2 day)",
            deltaDateRequired: 2,
        }),
        new StageBaseModel("talk_alice2", {
            name: "Talk to Alice",
            description: "Talk to Alice on the terrace",
        }),
    ],
    {
        // props
        name: "Help Alice",
        description:
            'To learn more about how the repo works, Talk to Alice. \nGoing when she is there will automatically start an "Event" (see aliceQuest.tsx to learn more). \nAfter that an action will be added to open the pc, in MC room. \n\n(during the quest you can talk to Alice and you will see her talking during the quests of the same Quest)',
        image: "alice_terrace0A",
        onStart: (quest, { notify, uiTransition }) => {
            notify(uiTransition("notify_quest_is_started", { quest: quest.name }));
        },
        onNextStage: (stage, { notify, uiTransition }) => {
            notify(uiTransition("notify_quest_is_updated", { quest: stage.name }));
        },
    }
);

RegisteredQuests.add(aliceQuest);
```

```ts tab="src/main.ts"
import "./values/aliceQuest";

// ...
```

`RegisteredQuests.add` is **required** to save the `quests` in the game.

You can also create a function to load `quests`. The important thing is that it is called at least once before the `quests` are used in the game, otherwise they will not be available.

## Start

To start a `quest`, you can use the `start` method of the Quest class. This method will set the current stage to the first stage of the quest and trigger the `onStart` action defined in the quest. This function has the following parameters:

* `props`: the properties that will be passed to `onStart`. Its interface corresponds to <DynamicLink href="/nqtr#onrunprops">`OnRunProps`</DynamicLink>.

```ts tab="start-quest.ts"
import { newLabel } from "@drincs/pixi-vn";
import { aliceQuest } from "../values/quests";

const startLabel = newLabel("start", [
    async (props) => {
        await aliceQuest.start(props); // [!code focus]
    },
]);
export default startLabel;
```

## Go next

To go to the next stage of a `quest`, you can use the `goNext` method of the Quest class. This method will set the current stage to the next stage of the quest and trigger the `onNextStage` action defined in the quest. This function has the following parameters:

* `props`: the properties that will be passed to `onNextStage`. Its interface corresponds to <DynamicLink href="/nqtr#onrunprops">`OnRunProps`</DynamicLink>.

```ts tab="next-stage.ts"
import { newLabel } from "@drincs/pixi-vn";
import { aliceQuest } from "../values/quests";

const nextStageLabel = newLabel("next_stage", [
    async (props) => {
        await aliceQuest.goNext(props); // [!code focus]
    },
]);
export default nextStageLabel;
```

<Accordions>

<Accordion title="Go next only if is completed" id="go-next-only-if-is-completed">

To go to the next stage of a `quest` only if the current stage is completed, you can use the `goNextIfCompleted` method of the Quest class. This method will check if the current stage is completed and then set the current stage to the next stage of the quest and trigger the `onNextStage` action defined in the quest. This function has the following parameters:

* `props`: the properties that will be passed to `onNextStage`. Its interface corresponds to <DynamicLink href="/nqtr#onrunprops">`OnRunProps`</DynamicLink>.

```ts tab="next-stage-if-completed.ts"
import { newLabel } from "@drincs/pixi-vn";
import { aliceQuest } from "../values/quests";

const nextStageIfCompletedLabel = newLabel("next_stage_if_completed", [
    async (props) => {
        await aliceQuest.goNextIfCompleted(props); // [!code focus]
    },
]);
export default nextStageIfCompletedLabel;
```

</Accordion>

</Accordions>

## Get

To get a `quest` by its `id`, use the `RegisteredQuests.get` function.

```ts
import { RegisteredQuests } from "@drincs/nqtr";

const aliceQuest = RegisteredQuests.get('aliceQuest');
```

## Get all

To get all `quests`, use the `RegisteredQuests.values` function.

```ts
import { RegisteredQuests } from "@drincs/nqtr";

const quests = RegisteredQuests.values();
```

## Custom class

<Callout title="Templates" type="info">

In all templates, the `Quest` class is already defined in the file `models/nqtr/Quest.ts`. You can use it directly or modify it to suit your needs.

</Callout>

It is recommended to create your own class `Quest` that extends `QuestStoredClass` and "override" the interface `QuestInterface` to add, edit, or remove properties or methods.

For example, if you want to create a class `Quest`, you must "override" the interface `QuestInterface` to use your properties or methods. (See the file `nqtr.d.ts`)

Now you can create a class `Quest` that extends `QuestStoredClass` and implements the `QuestInterface`. (For more information on how to create a class in TypeScript, read [the official documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/classes.html))

To create a property that stores its value in the game storage, you can create [Getters/Setters](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/classes.html#getters--setters) and use the `this.getStorageProperty()` / `this.setStorageProperty()` methods. (See the file `Quest.ts`)

```ts tab="models/nqtr/Quest.ts"
import { QuestInterface, QuestStoredClass, QuestStoredClassProps, StageInterface } from "@drincs/nqtr";

export default class Quest extends QuestStoredClass implements QuestInterface {
    constructor(
        id: string,
        _stages: StageInterface[],
        props: {
            name?: string;
            description?: string;
            image?: string;
            inDevelopment?: boolean;
        } & QuestStoredClassProps
    ) {
        super(id, _stages, props);
        this.name = props.name || "";
        this.description = props.description || "";
        this.image = props.image;
        this.inDevelopment = props.inDevelopment || false;
    }
    readonly name: string;
    readonly description: string;
    readonly image?: string;
    readonly inDevelopment: boolean;
}
```

```ts tab="nqtr.d.ts"
declare module "@drincs/nqtr" {
    interface QuestInterface {
        /**
         * The name of the quest.
         */
        readonly name: string;
        /**
         * The description of the quest.
         */
        readonly description: string;
        /**
         * The image of the quest.
         */
        readonly image?: string;
        /**
         * If the quest is in development.
         */
        readonly inDevelopment: boolean;
    }
}
```
