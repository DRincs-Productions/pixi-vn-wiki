title: Time system
---

<Callout title="Nomenclature" type="info">
The time system is based on two numeric variables: date and time. Both of these variables have very generic names to give the developer freedom to use them as they wish.

The **date** is a counter that equals the number of days, or another time period chosen by the user, that have passed since the start of the game.
