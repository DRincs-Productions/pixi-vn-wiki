Before continuing, it is important to consider that this page assumes the concepts explained in <DynamicLink href="/start#make-visual-novel">"Make your first Visual Novel"</DynamicLink>, and that all the features explained on that page can also be applied here. Additionally, having an intermediate knowledge of JS/TS (such as functions, classes, interfaces, and the use of `.d.ts` files) is essential.
Do not continue if you do not have this knowledge.

This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating your first Point & Click Adventure.

**What is a Point & Click Adventure?** A Point & Click Adventure is a game genre in which the player interacts with the environment and objects through mouse pointing and clicking. These games often feature puzzles, dialogues, and an engaging narrative.

**How to implement it in a Pixi’VN project?** The Pixi’VN environment provides a utility library and base models called `NQTR` (Navigation Quest Time Routine), which allow you to easily implement a navigation system, time management, and quests. The way NQTR works is based on creating class instances that comply with specific interfaces, which will be registered and provided by the NQTR utilities. In this way, it is possible to create a UI tailored to the game's needs. Alternatively, you can use the base models provided by NQTR and the UI included in the "Point & Click Adventure - React" template to create a complete game in a short time.

Additionally, it is very important to consider that elements can trigger `labels` (narratives), allowing you to switch to the narrative interface and back.

## Create a new project

The first step is to create a new project. You can find more information on how to create a new project starting from a template <DynamicLink href="/start#project-initialization">here</DynamicLink>. We will use the template "Point & Click Adventure - React".

`Point & Click Adventure -> React`

After the creation is complete, it is very important to read the `README.md` file that is in the root of the project. This file contains important information about the project and how to use it.

In our case, to start the project we will simply need to execute the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Navigation elements

<Callout type="info">

You can find more detailed documentation about these elements <DynamicLink href="/nqtr#navigation">here</DynamicLink>.

</Callout>

The first step to create a Point & Click Adventure is to create the navigation elements. These elements allow the player to move within the game and interact with the environment.

The navigation system is composed of the following elements:

* `rooms`: The core elements of navigation, from which the position of the `mc` and `npc` is deduced.
* `locations`: A container of `rooms`.
* `maps`: A container of `locations`.

For example:

```ts title="values/rooms.ts"
import { RegisteredRooms, RoomBaseModel } from "@drincs/nqtr";
import { mcHome } from "./locations";

export const mcRoom = new RoomBaseModel("mc_room", mcHome, {
    name: "MC room",
});

RegisteredRooms.add([mcRoom]);
```

```ts title="values/locations.ts"
import { LocationBaseModel, RegisteredLocations } from "@drincs/nqtr";
import { mainMap } from "./maps";

export const mcHome = new LocationBaseModel("mc_home", mainMap, {
    name: "MC Home",
});

RegisteredLocations.add([mcHome]);
```

```ts title="values/maps.ts"
import { MapBaseModel, RegisteredMaps } from "@drincs/nqtr";

export const mainMap = new MapBaseModel("main_map", {
    name: "Main Map",
});

RegisteredMaps.add([mainMap]);
```

Now, before you can use the navigation utilities, you need to set the current room. After that, it is possible to navigate to the navigation screen at the start of the game or after a short initial narrative.

<Callout type="info">

You can find more detailed documentation on how to navigate between UI screens <DynamicLink href="/start#interface-navigate">here</DynamicLink>.

</Callout>

For example:

```ink tab="ink" title="ink/start.ink" groupId="narrative_language"
=== start ===
    # navigate /narration
    Hello, welcome to the my first game!

    # enter room mc_room
    # navigate /navigation
    -> DONE
```

```ts tab="Typescript" title="labels/startLabel.ts" groupId="narrative_language"
import { navigator } from "@drincs/nqtr";
import { narration, newLabel } from "@drincs/pixi-vn";
import { mcRoom } from "../values/rooms";

const startLabel = newLabel("start", [
    async (props) => {
        await props.navigate("/narration");
        narration.dialogue = "Hello, welcome to the my first game!";
    },
    async (props) => {
        navigator.currentRoom = mcRoom;
        await props.navigate("/navigation");
    },
]);
export default startLabel;
```
