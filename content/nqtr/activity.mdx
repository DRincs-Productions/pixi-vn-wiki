## Initialize

To initialize a `activity`, create a new instance of the `ActivityBaseModel` class (or your [custom class](#custom-class)) and add it to the game activity dictionary when the game is initialized.

<Callout type="info">

It is recommended to import the instances at project startup, see the `src/main.ts` file.

</Callout>

To create a new instance of `ActivityBaseModel`, you need the following parameters:

```ts tab="values/activities.ts"
import { ActivityBaseModel, RegisteredActivities, timeTracker } from "@drincs/nqtr";
import { narration } from "@drincs/pixi-vn";
import { napLabel, sleepLabel } from "../labels/sleepNapLabels";
import { orderProductLabel, takeKeyLabel } from "../labels/variousActionsLabels";

export const bed = new ActivityBaseModel(
    "bed",
    async (_, props) => {
        if (timeTracker.nowIsBetween(5, 22)) {
            await narration.jumpLabel(napLabel, props);
        } else {
            await narration.jumpLabel(sleepLabel, props);
        }
    },
    {
        name: "bed",
    }
);

export const orderProduct = new ActivityBaseModel(
    "order_product",
    async (_, props) => await narration.jumpLabel(orderProductLabel, props),
    {
        name: "order_product",
    }
);

export const takeProduct = new ActivityBaseModel(
    "take_product",
    async (_, props) => await narration.jumpLabel(takeKeyLabel, props),
    {
        name: "take_product",
    }
);

RegisteredActivities.add([bed, orderProduct, takeProduct]);
```

```ts tab="src/main.ts"
import "./values/activities";

// ...
```

`RegisteredActivities.add` is **required** to save the `activities` in the game.

You can also create a function to load `activities`. The important thing is that it is called at least once before the `activities` are used in the game, otherwise they will not be available.
