**What is Tailwind CSS?** Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs. It is a low-level framework that provides a set of utility classes that can be used to build custom designs without having to leave the HTML. You can get more information on how install it [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).

You can learn more about Tailwind CSS on the [Tailwind CSS website](https://tailwindcss.com/).

It is also possible to install Tailwind CSS Plugins. Here is a list of some of them:

- [Tailwind CSS Motion](https://docs.rombo.co/tailwind): Add animations to your Tailwind CSS project.

It is recommended to use Tailwind CSS in your Pixiâ€™VN project to add styling or animations to your dialogue text. Here is an example using the `tailwindcss-motion` plugin:

```ts [labels/startLabel.ts]
import { narration, newLabel } from "@drincs/pixi-vn";

const startLabel = newLabel("start", [
    async () => {
        narration.dialogue = `<span className='motion-translate-y-loop-25'>Hello</span>, welcome to the game!`;
    },
]);
export default startLabel;
```
