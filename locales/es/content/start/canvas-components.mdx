title: Canvas components
---

Pixi’VN provides a set of canvas components. These components are based on [Pixi.js](https://pixijs.com/) components and add features to save their current state and more to enhance their capabilities.

**What is the canvas components?** Components are reusable building blocks for canvas apps so that app makers can create custom controls to use inside an app, or across apps using a component library. Components can use advanced features such as custom properties and enable complex capabilities.

## Base components

The available components are:

- `Sprite` corresponds to the component [PixiJS.Sprite](https://pixijs.com/8.x/guides/components/sprites).
- `Container` corresponds to the component [PixiJS.Container](https://pixijs.com/8.x/guides/components/containers).
- `Text` corresponds to the component [PixiJS.Text](https://pixijs.com/8.x/guides/components/text).
- [ImageSprite](/start/canvas-images) is a conponent introduced by Pixi’VN.
- [ImageContainer](/start/canvas-image-container) is a conponent introduced by Pixi’VN.
- [VideoSprite](/start/canvas-videos) is a conponent introduced by Pixi’VN.

## Custom components

You can create custom components by extending the base components. To do this you need to use the decorator `@canvasComponentDecorator`.

`@canvasComponentDecorator` is a decorator that save the canvas component in memory. It have a optional parameter that is the id of the canvas component (must be unique). If you don't pass the id, the class name will be used as the id. ( [How enable the decorators in TypeScript?](/start/getting-started#how-enable-the-decorators-in-typescript) )

And is necessary to override the `memory` property to store the custom component properties.
In `get memory()` it is very important to return the `className` property, this property must be equal to the id used in the decorator.

For example, you can create an ʻAlienTinting` class that extends the ʻSprite` class to manage the direction and speed of each individual alien in an animation.

```typescript title="canvas/components/AlienTinting.ts"
@canvasComponentDecorator() // or @canvasComponentDecorator("AlienTintingTest")
class AlienTintingTest extends Sprite<IAlienTintingMemory> {
    override get memory() {
        return {
            ...super.memory,
            direction: this.direction,
            turningSpeed: this.turningSpeed,
            speed: this.speed,
            className: "AlienTintingTest",
        }
    }
    override set memory(memory: IAlienTintingMemory) {
        super.memory = memory as ICanvasSpriteMemory
        this.direction = memory.direction
        this.turningSpeed = memory.turningSpeed
        this.speed = memory.speed
    }
    direction: number = 0
    turningSpeed: number = 0
    speed: number = 0
    static override from(source: Texture | TextureSourceLike, skipCache?: boolean) {
        let sprite = Sprite.from(source, skipCache)
        let mySprite = new AlienTintingTest()
        mySprite.texture = sprite.texture
        return mySprite
    }
}
```
