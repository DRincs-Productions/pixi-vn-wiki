title: Articulated animations and effects
---

The articulated animations and effects are functions used to trigger complex animations and effects. They combine more [primitive animations and effects (Tickers)](/start/canvas-tickers) to create a more complex animation or effect. For example, the `Shake` function is an articulated animation that uses more `MoveTicker` to create a shake effect.

## Shake

The `shakeEffect` function is an articulated animation that shakes the canvas element. The function uses more `MoveTicker` to create the shake effect.

This function have the following parameters:

- `alias`: the alias of the canvas element
- `props`: the properties of the shake effect. The properties are:
  - `speed` (Optional): is a number that represents the speed of the shake effect.
  - `shocksNumber` (Optional): the number of shocks.
  - `type` (Optional): the type of the shake effect.
  - `maximumShockSize` (Optional): the maximum size of the shock.
  - `speedProgression` (Optional): in case the shake needs to increase/decrease in speed over time, this property can be used. You can read more about it [here](/start/canvas-tickers#speed-progression-property).
  - `startOnlyIfHaveTexture` (Optional): is a boolean that represents if the animation should start only if the canvas component have a texture not empty. If `true` and the canvas component not have a texture, the animation will not edit the `x` and `y` properties, but will be executed. You can read more about it [here](/start/canvas-tickers#start-only-if-have-texture-property).
- `priority` (Optional): the priority of the ticker
