title: Desktop & mobile devices
---

There are many ways to distribute your game on desktop and mobile devices. You can use [Tauri](https://v2.tauri.app/), [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/), [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), [NW.js](https://nwjs.io/), or [React Native for Windows + Mac](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/).

However, if you do not want to create a project with large customizations, I recommend using the [multi-device templates](/start/getting-started#project-initialization), in which Tauri has been added in order to allow both the development of a Web app and the development of desktop and mobile applications.

## Tauri

**What is Tauri?** Tauri is a framework that allows you to create desktop applications with web technologies. Tauri uses **Rust** to create a secure and fast application, and it uses a WebView to render the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript of your application.

You can learn more about Tauri on the [Tauri website](https://v2.tauri.app/).

## How to distribute your game with Tauri

Generating releases manually for all devices is not an easy process, because it requires installing many programs and for iOS applications you need a mac. Precisely for this reason it is not recommended. (You can get more information on how to manually generate releases [here](https://v2.tauri.app/distribute/))

[Tauri gives the possibility to use GitHub Actions](https://v2.tauri.app/distribute/pipelines/github/) to generate releases autonomously. **What is GitHub Actions?** To explain it so that everyone can understand it, GitHub to automate repetitive processes that you would have to do manually, by having "machines" with the OS you prefer for a certain period of time. with `.yml` files you can set a list of commands that will have to perform after a certain event.

The [multi-device templates](/start/getting-started#project-initialization) have inside the file `/.github/workflows/tauri.yml` which has the purpose of creating a release not inside the installation packages for all OS.

To activate this procedure you need to have your own project on GitHub and create a tag on git that starts with the letter "v". Ad esempio:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

In the Actions section of your Repository you can view the status of this procedure.

![Actions section](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b39055a9-02a7-472b-930f-daf0a9c6c78b)

At its end a Release will be created. Read more about the GitHub Releases [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/viewing-your-repositorys-releases-and-tags).

Currently the mobile release with GitHub Actions is in development you can get more information [here](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-action/pull/924).
