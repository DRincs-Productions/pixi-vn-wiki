# Using Sounds and Music in *ink*

Pixiâ€™VN allows you to use in the ***ink* syntax** the possibility to use the [Sounds and Music](/start/sound.md).

The syntax is as follows:

`#` + `sound operation` + `sound` + `tag of the sound element` + `parameters`

* `#` It is a special character used by ***ink* syntax** for add Special Commands.
* `sound operation` It is the operation that you want to do with the sound element. The available operations are `add`, `play`, `pause`, `resume`, `remove` and `volume`.
* `tag of the sound element` It is the tag of the sound element. The tag is a string that identifies the sound element.
  * If the tag includes spaces, you must use double quotes.
* `parameters` It is the parameters of the operation. The parameters depend on the operation.
  * If the parameters include spaces, you must use double quotes.
  * If the parameters is a object, you must use the JSON format and the first character must be `\{` and the last character must be `\}`. Example: `\{ "volume": 100, name: "Music" \}`
