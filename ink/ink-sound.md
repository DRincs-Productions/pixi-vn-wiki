# Use sounds and music in *ink*

The ***ink* + Pixiâ€™VN integration** introduces the a # script that allows you to use the [sounds and music](/start/sound.md).

The syntax is as follows:

`#` + `[operation]` + `sound` + `[alias]` + `[parameters]`

Where:

* `#`: It is a special character used by ***ink* syntax** for use a special script.
* `[operation]`: It is the operation that you want to execute with the sound element. The available operations are:
  * `play`: play a sound
  * `pause`: pause a sound
  * `resume`: resume a sound
  * `stop`: stop a sound
  * `volume`: change the volume of a sound
* `[alias]` It is the alias of the sound element. The alias is a string that identifies the sound element.
  * If the alias includes spaces, you must use double quotes.
* `[parameters]` It is the parameters of the operation. The parameters depend on the operation.
  * If the parameters include spaces, you must use double quotes.
  * If the parameters is a object, you must use the JSON format and the first character must be `\{` and the last character must be `\}`. Example: `\{ "volume": 100, name: "Music" \}`

## Play a sound in *ink*

After the alias of the sound element, you can add the `SoundPlayOptions` parameters. These parameters do not have a precise order and must be set as follows: `parameterName` + `SPACE` + `value`. If the `value` is a string you must use double quotes.
