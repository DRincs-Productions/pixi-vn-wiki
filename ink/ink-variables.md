# *ink* variables

As explained in the [official documentation](https://github.com/inkle/ink/blob/master/Documentation/WritingWithInk.md#part-3-variables-and-logic) of the ***ink* language**:

***ink*** also supports variables, both temporary and global, storing numerical and content data, or even story flow commands. It is fully-featured in terms of logic, and contains a few additional structures to help keep the often complex logic of a branching story better organised.
