# Use canvas in *ink*

The ***ink* + Pixiâ€™VN integration** introduces the a # script that allows you to show, edit, remove and etc. a [canvas element](/start/canvas-elements.md).

The syntax is as follows:

`#` + `[operation]` + `[type of the canvas element]` + `[alias]` + `[parameters]`

Where:

* `#`: It is a special character used by ***ink* syntax** for use a special script.
* `[operation]`: It is the operation that you want to execute with the canvas element. The available operations are:
  * `show`: Show a canvas element. (Read more [here](#show-canvas-element-in-ink))
  * `edit`: Edit a canvas element. (Read more [here](#edit-canvas-element-in-ink))
  * `remove`: Remove a canvas element. (Read more [here](#remove-canvas-element-in-ink))
  * `pause` (Only for video): Pause a video canvas element. (Read more [here](#pause-video-canvas-element-in-ink))
  * `resume` (Only for video): Resume a video canvas element. (Read more [here](#resume-video-canvas-element-in-ink))
* `[type of the canvas element]` It is the type of the canvas element. The available types are:
  * [`image`](/start/images.md)
  * [`video`](/start/videos.md)
* `[alias]` It is the [alias of the canvas element](/start/canvas-alias.md). The alias is a string that identifies the canvas element.
  * If the alias includes spaces, you must use double quotes.
* `[parameters]` It is the parameters of the operation. The parameters depend on the operation.
  * If the parameters include spaces, you must use double quotes.
  * If the parameters is a object, you must use the JSON format and the first character must be `\{` and the last character must be `\}`. Example: `\{ "color": "red", isVisble: true, position: { x: 100, y: 100 } \}`

## Show canvas element in *ink*

You can use the `show` to show a [canvas element](/start/canvas-elements.md) in ***ink***.

This operation requires the alias of the canvas element and the URL/path of the image. Keep in mind that to write `https://` in ***ink*** you must use `https:\/\/` because the `//` is a comment in ***ink***.

Afer the URL/path of the image, you can add the `parameters` of the [canvas element](/start/canvas-elements.md) that you want to set. The `parameters` must be set as follows: `parameterName` + `SPACE` + `value`. If the `value` is a string and includes spaces, you must use double quotes.

The syntax is as follows:

`#` + `show` + `[type of the canvas element]` + `[alias]` + `[URL/path of the image]` + `[parameters]`

```ink
# show image bg /image.png
# show image "bg 2 alice" https:\/\/game.com/image.png
# show image bg https:\/\/game.com/image.png x 20 y 30 visible true cursor "pointer" alpha 0.5
```

### Show canvas element with transition in *ink*

If you want to show the canvas element with a [transition](/start/transition.md), you can add into the parameters the `with [transitionType]`.

`#` + `show` + `[type of the canvas element]` + `[alias]` + `[URL/path of the image]` + `[parameters]` + `with` + `[transitionType]`

After the `transitionType`, you can add the `transition parameters`. the `transition parameters` must be set as follows: `parameterName` + `SPACE` + `value`. If the `value` is a string and includes spaces, you must use double quotes.

The syntax is as follows:

`#` + `show` + `[type of the canvas element]` + `[alias]` + `[URL/path of the image]` + `[parameters]` + `with` + `[transitionType]` + `[transition parameters]`

The available transitions are:

* `dissolve`: The canvas element appears with a [dissolve transition](/start/transition.md#dissolve-transition). You can add all the parameters you would use in JS/TS.
* `fade`: The canvas element appears with a [fade transition](/start/transition.md#fade-transition). You can add all the parameters you would use in JS/TS.
* `movein`: The canvas element appears with a [movein transition](/start/transition.md#move-inout-transition). You can add all the parameters you would use in JS/TS.
* `zoomin`: The canvas element appears with a [zoomin transition](/start/transition.md#zoom-inout-transition). You can add all the parameters you would use in JS/TS.
* `pushin`: The canvas element appears with a [pushin transition](/start/transition.md#push-inout-transition). You can add all the parameters you would use in JS/TS.

```ink
# show image bg /image.png with dissolve duration 3
temp durationVar = 3
# show image bg /image.png with fade duration {durationVar}
# show image bg /image.png x 20 y 30 with movein
# show image bg /image.png x 20 y 30 with zoomin
# show image bg /image.png x 20 y 30 with pushin
```

## Edit canvas element in *ink*

To edit a canvas element in ***ink***, you can use the `edit` operation. After the alias of the canvas element, you must include the properties of [canvas element](/start/canvas-elements.md) that you want to edit.

In the `parameters` you must include the properties that you want to edit. The properties must be set as follows: `propertyName` + `SPACE` + `value`. If the `value` is a string you must use double quotes.

```ink
# edit image bg position \{ "x": 20, "y": 30 \} visible true  cursor "pointer" alpha 0.5 
```

## Remove canvas element in *ink*

To remove a canvas element in ***ink***, you can use the `remove` operation.

```ink
# remove image bg
# remove image "bg 2"
```

### Remove canvas element with transition in *ink*

If you want to remove the canvas element with a [transition](/start/transition.md), you can add after the alias of the canvas element the `with` + `SPACE` + `transitionType`. After the transition type, you can add the transition parameters. These parameters do not have a precise order and must be set as follows: `parameterName` + `SPACE` + `value`. If the `value` is a string you must use double quotes.

The first parameter is the transition type, the available transitions are:

* `dissolve`: The canvas element disappears with a [dissolve transition](/start/transition.md#dissolve-transition). You can add all the parameters you would use in JS/TS.
* `fade`: The canvas element disappears with a [fade transition](/start/transition.md#fade-transition). You can add all the parameters you would use in JS/TS.
* `moveout`: The canvas element disappears with a [moveout transition](/start/transition.md#move-inout-transition). You can add all the parameters you would use in JS/TS.
* `zoomout`: The canvas element disappears with a [zoomout transition](/start/transition.md#zoom-inout-transition). You can add all the parameters you would use in JS/TS.
* `pushout`: The canvas element disappears with a [pushout transition](/start/transition.md#push-inout-transition). You can add all the parameters you would use in JS/TS.

```ink
# remove image bg with dissolve duration 3
temp durationVar = 3
# remove image bg with fade duration {durationVar}
# remove image bg with moveout
# remove image bg with zoomout
# remove image bg with pushout
```

## Use Effects in *ink*

You can use the [effects](/start/animations-effects.md) in ***ink***.

If you want to use an effect in ***ink***, you can use how `[operation]` the name of the effect.

The syntax is as follows:
  
`#` + `[effectType]` + `[alias]` + `[parameters]`
  
```ink
# fade bg duration 3
temp durationVar = 3
# fade bg duration {durationVar}
# move bg x 20 y 30 duration 3
# rotate bg clockwise false duration 3
# zoom bg scale 2 duration 3
# shake bg duration 3
