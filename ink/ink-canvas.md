# Use Canvas in *ink*

Pixiâ€™VN allows you to use in the ***ink* syntax** the possibility to use the [Canvas](/start/canvas.md).

The syntax is as follows:

`#` + `canvas operation` + `type of the canvas element` + `tag of the canvas element` + `parameters`

* `#` It is a special character used by ***ink* syntax** for add "Special Commands".
* `canvas operation` It is the operation that you want to do with the canvas element. The available operations are `show`, `edit`, and `remove`. In addition only for the video canvas element are `pause` and `resume`.
* `type of the canvas element` It is the type of the canvas element. The available types are `image` and `video`.
* `tag of the canvas element` It is the tag of the canvas element. The tag is a string that identifies the canvas element.
  * If the tag includes spaces, you must use double quotes.
* `parameters` It is the parameters of the operation. The parameters depend on the operation.
  * If the parameters include spaces, you must use double quotes.
  * If the parameters is a object, you must use the JSON format and the first character must be `\{` and the last character must be `\}`. Example: `\{ "color": "red", isVisble: true, position: { x: 100, y: 100 } \}`

After the transition type, you can add the transition parameters. These parameters do not have a precise order and must be set as follows: `parameterName` + `SPACE` + `value`. If the `value` is a string you must use double quotes.
